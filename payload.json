The film also uncovers the region\u2019s hidden gems with Kerch native, singer Alyona Sviridova, who meets Crimeans for whom the bridge link is vital. \nWith the bridge deck 35 metres above the water, the giant structure stretches 19 kilometres (12 miles). The bridge is expected to carry up to 40,000 vehicles and 94 trains a day, once it becomes fully operational in 2019. \nAlthough plans to span the strait with a bridge date back to the 19th century, the link became a practical necessity for the peninsula, which only has a land border with Ukraine, after Crimeans overwhelming voted to rejoin Russia in 2014. \nNikolay Valuev begins his journey at the construction camp on the Taman Peninsula, where he joins men and women working on the site. To get the first-hand experience, Nikolay tries various jobs, from welding large metal tubes for future piles, to pouring concrete and operating an elevator which lifts builders onto the arches. \nThe installation of the 6,000-ton arches marked a milestone in the construction of what is said to be the longest bridge in Europe and one of the largest in Russia. \nThe link will significantly cut the time people have to spend on the road, queueing at the busy ferry crossing, often troubled by bad weather. \u201cIt took us three days of waiting in line to get on the ferry out of Crimea and a week to get on the ferry back,\u201d says Yulia, who drives a truck from the resort city of Evpatoria to Moscow. \nOnce complete, the bridge will also make it easier for holidaymakers to reach Crimea, a popular tourist destination for Russians. However, it\u2019s not only the Black Sea resorts that are worth visiting. \nFrom getting muddy in Lake Chokrak, dubbed the Crimean Dead Sea, to fishing for anchovies, and grocery shopping at Kerch market, Alyona shows some of the off the beaten track Crimean attractions. \nAlyona meets a Crimean Tatar, named Reshat, who is searching for a bride. As he wants his future wife to be from Crimea, Reshat takes long, arduous journeys via ferry to the peninsula in pursuit of love. \n\u201cNever mind the wines, it\u2019s the bridge that connects us,\u201d Irina tells her sister. \nWith the Crimean Bridge now open to car traffic, learn more about the building of the much-awaited connection and get an inside look at Crimea\u2019s must-see places. \n\n\nCheck out http://rt.com\n\nRT LIVE http://rt.com/on-air\n\nSubscribe to RT! http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=RussiaToday\n\nLike us on Facebook http://www.facebook.com/RTnews\nFollow us on Telegram https://t.me/rtintl\nFollow us on VK https://vk.com/rt_international\nFollow us on Twitter http://twitter.com/RT_com\nFollow us on Instagram http://instagram.com/rt\nFollow us on Google+ http://plus.google.com/+RT\n\nRT (Russia Today) is a global news network broadcasting from Moscow and Washington studios.

Fraternities include: Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc., Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc., and Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc. Sororities include: Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc., and Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc.\n\nNPHC organizations do not use a recruitment process similar to the one used by the Interfraternity Council or the Panhellenic Council. NPHC organizations have open recruitment periods that are deemed by the specific organization, not by NPHC. Specific requirements vary by organization. Check out an organization's local or national website for specific intake requirements.\n\nAlso, be aware that organizations will hold informational meetings throughout the school year. These meetings will be advertised on campus billboards and in the student center. These meetings will enable one to learn more about an organization, and perhaps get specific intake questions answered.\n\nIf you are interested in joining one of these chapters, there will be several NPHC sponsored events held during Welcome Week in the fall. Individual chapters will advertise informational meetings throughout the year. Most of these chapters hold intake in the spring semester, however, a few conduct the process in the fall. Achieving high scholarship, serving the community and mentoring youth are the primary focuses of the above mentioned chapters. For many of the chapters, individuals interested in membership are asked to submit a transcript and recommendations that reflect his or her academic achievement and service.

Comment Below!\n\nDon\u2019t forget to turn on notifications, like, & subscribe!", "\u2605 Subscribe ACTUALLY HAPPENED: https://bit.ly/2J5HP7j\n\nThis is Jo. Actually, her name is Josephine, but you wouldn\u2019t be able to imagine a person less suitable to be called Josephine. She\u2019s a tomboy, and she\u2019s proud of it. However, life as a tomboy is not as amusing as you might imagine. She\u2019s faced a lot of problems, and she wants to tell you about them.\n\nJo had trouble communicating with other girls right from her early childhood. She remembers one time when a large group of children had gathered in one place for a party or something, and her mom gently pushed her towards the other girls and said, \u201cgo play with the dolls, make friends with someone!\u201d She diligently started moving dolls here and there and listening to boring talk about girly problems, but all the while she kept looking at the boys, who were playing something thrilling, laughing and doing their boyish stuff. She was so envious that at some point she just silently stood up and joined them. That was the moment when the fun started for her.\n\nThings didn\u2019t improve as the years went by. Jo was always attracted to the world of boys, and all of her friends were boys as well. She felt at ease when she talked to them, and felt that she understood their problems and their way of thinking better. Whereas when she was around girls, she was totally clueless. Their problems were hard for her to follow, especially when they complained about boys.\n\nJo had to adapt her looks to her lifestyle as well. When she went out with her friends, they always did something active, like skateboarding or exploring abandoned buildings or climbing trees. For these kinds of things, you need to dress in a practical way. She found out that jeans and hoodies are much more comfortable in this respect than typical girls\u2019 clothes, which she had always hated in any case. And that is how she has dressed her whole life. For Jo, it was always a tragedy when they made some formal visit and she needed to dress \u201cproperly\u201d, as people would call it. A cute dress, shiny shoes, a neat hairdo\u2026 ugh. As you can probably imagine, phrases like \u201cwear skirts, be more feminine, you\u2019re a girl\u201d were the things she kept hearing time and again, until at one point her parents just gave up.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that Jo felt she was ugly or anything, and that being a tomboy was her way of gaining confidence. She actually thinks she\u2019s quite cute, and when she\u2019s forced to be a girly girl she looks no worse than her peers. For her, being a tomboy is a lifestyle, and she\u2019s happy with that. The problem was that some time ago, she\u2019d noticed that her friends had started dating.\n\nOne of the things that people were often mistaken about was the belief that because Jo was a tomboy, she must be gay. But she\u2019s actually attracted to boys, not girls. Ironically, she actually gets a lot of backtalking from girls who say that she\u2019s just trying to get attention from all the boys around her. She\u2019s never taken this seriously, because she\u2019s never had THAT kind of attention from the boys. Which is actually the core of her problem.\n\nYes, she\u2019s seeking her first romance. She has lots of boys around her. So what\u2019s the problem, you might ask. The problem is that they don\u2019t really see her as a girl! They know she\u2019s a girl, of course, but they don\u2019t want to date her, because who would date a bro? Once, there was a boy she liked, and she thought it would be wise to approach him and ask if he wanted to go out with her. And guess what \u2013 he just laughed at her! He wasn\u2019t mean or anything, it was more something like \u201cSorry bro, I don\u2019t see you as a GIRL\u201d. Seeing the look on her face, he corrected himself: \u201cI mean, THAT kind of a girl\u201d. Oh thanks, now that\u2019s much better!\n\nThis was the first time when being a tomboy had a negative effect on her life. She even tried to put on make up and a dress, but felt really weird and the boys just looked at her strange as well. She gave up and lost hope. It seemed like it was a price that she had to pay to keep the comfortable and amusing life of a tomboy. She became a bit melancholic looking at all those happy couples, and felt that something was missing from her life for the first time.\n\nOne day she was invited out to go skateboarding, but she wasn\u2019t in the mood so she just sat there, watching her friends and thinking her sad thoughts. One of her oldest friends soon came over to sit with her and asked why she was so sad. She didn\u2019t want to lie, so she explained everything as it really was \u2013 that no one wanted to date her because no one considered her a potential girlfriend. \u201cDon\u2019t cry\u201d, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll go on a date with you!\u201d She refused out self-respect. \u201cI don\u2019t need charity\u201d, she said. Suddenly, he became very serious and said that he really wanted to. And so she accepted.

By walking a mile in the shoes of his overweight clients, PJ wanted to experience the emotional, psychological and physical effects of obesity, first hand. His 12 month  journey from FIT TO FAT AND BACK shocked the world and brought huge awareness to the obesity epidemic. PJ also inspired countless other trainers to follow in his footsteps and gain weight in order to try and understand the struggles of their overweight clients.

The film also uncovers the region\u2019s hidden gems with Kerch native, singer Alyona Sviridova, who meets Crimeans for whom the bridge link is vital. \nWith the bridge deck 35 metres above the water, the giant structure stretches 19 kilometres (12 miles). The bridge is expected to carry up to 40,000 vehicles and 94 trains a day, once it becomes fully operational in 2019. \nAlthough plans to span the strait with a bridge date back to the 19th century, the link became a practical necessity for the peninsula, which only has a land border with Ukraine, after Crimeans overwhelming voted to rejoin Russia in 2014. \nNikolay Valuev begins his journey at the construction camp on the Taman Peninsula, where he joins men and women working on the site. To get the first-hand experience, Nikolay tries various jobs, from welding large metal tubes for future piles, to pouring concrete and operating an elevator which lifts builders onto the arches. \nThe installation of the 6,000-ton arches marked a milestone in the construction of what is said to be the longest bridge in Europe and one of the largest in Russia. \nThe link will significantly cut the time people have to spend on the road, queueing at the busy ferry crossing, often troubled by bad weather. \u201cIt took us three days of waiting in line to get on the ferry out of Crimea and a week to get on the ferry back,\u201d says Yulia, who drives a truck from the resort city of Evpatoria to Moscow. \nOnce complete, the bridge will also make it easier for holidaymakers to reach Crimea, a popular tourist destination for Russians. However, it\u2019s not only the Black Sea resorts that are worth visiting. \nFrom getting muddy in Lake Chokrak, dubbed the Crimean Dead Sea, to fishing for anchovies, and grocery shopping at Kerch market, Alyona shows some of the off the beaten track Crimean attractions. \nAlyona meets a Crimean Tatar, named Reshat, who is searching for a bride. As he wants his future wife to be from Crimea, Reshat takes long, arduous journeys via ferry to the peninsula in pursuit of love. \n\u201cNever mind the wines, it\u2019s the bridge that connects us,\u201d Irina tells her sister. \nWith the Crimean Bridge now open to car traffic, learn more about the building of the much-awaited connection and get an inside look at Crimea\u2019s must-see places. \n\n\nCheck out http://rt.com\n\nRT LIVE http://rt.com/on-air\n\nSubscribe to RT! http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=RussiaToday\n\nLike us on Facebook http://www.facebook.com/RTnews\nFollow us on Telegram https://t.me/rtintl\nFollow us on VK https://vk.com/rt_international\nFollow us on Twitter http://twitter.com/RT_com\nFollow us on Instagram http://instagram.com/rt\nFollow us on Google+ http://plus.google.com/+RT\n\nRT (Russia Today) is a global news network broadcasting from Moscow and Washington studios.

Fraternities include: Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc., Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc., and Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc. Sororities include: Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc., and Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc.\n\nNPHC organizations do not use a recruitment process similar to the one used by the Interfraternity Council or the Panhellenic Council. NPHC organizations have open recruitment periods that are deemed by the specific organization, not by NPHC. Specific requirements vary by organization. Check out an organization's local or national website for specific intake requirements.\n\nAlso, be aware that organizations will hold informational meetings throughout the school year. These meetings will be advertised on campus billboards and in the student center. These meetings will enable one to learn more about an organization, and perhaps get specific intake questions answered.\n\nIf you are interested in joining one of these chapters, there will be several NPHC sponsored events held during Welcome Week in the fall. Individual chapters will advertise informational meetings throughout the year. Most of these chapters hold intake in the spring semester, however, a few conduct the process in the fall. Achieving high scholarship, serving the community and mentoring youth are the primary focuses of the above mentioned chapters. For many of the chapters, individuals interested in membership are asked to submit a transcript and recommendations that reflect his or her academic achievement and service.

Comment Below!\n\nDon\u2019t forget to turn on notifications, like, & subscribe!", "\u2605 Subscribe ACTUALLY HAPPENED: https://bit.ly/2J5HP7j\n\nThis is Jo. Actually, her name is Josephine, but you wouldn\u2019t be able to imagine a person less suitable to be called Josephine. She\u2019s a tomboy, and she\u2019s proud of it. However, life as a tomboy is not as amusing as you might imagine. She\u2019s faced a lot of problems, and she wants to tell you about them.\n\nJo had trouble communicating with other girls right from her early childhood. She remembers one time when a large group of children had gathered in one place for a party or something, and her mom gently pushed her towards the other girls and said, \u201cgo play with the dolls, make friends with someone!\u201d She diligently started moving dolls here and there and listening to boring talk about girly problems, but all the while she kept looking at the boys, who were playing something thrilling, laughing and doing their boyish stuff. She was so envious that at some point she just silently stood up and joined them. That was the moment when the fun started for her.\n\nThings didn\u2019t improve as the years went by. Jo was always attracted to the world of boys, and all of her friends were boys as well. She felt at ease when she talked to them, and felt that she understood their problems and their way of thinking better. Whereas when she was around girls, she was totally clueless. Their problems were hard for her to follow, especially when they complained about boys.\n\nJo had to adapt her looks to her lifestyle as well. When she went out with her friends, they always did something active, like skateboarding or exploring abandoned buildings or climbing trees. For these kinds of things, you need to dress in a practical way. She found out that jeans and hoodies are much more comfortable in this respect than typical girls\u2019 clothes, which she had always hated in any case. And that is how she has dressed her whole life. For Jo, it was always a tragedy when they made some formal visit and she needed to dress \u201cproperly\u201d, as people would call it. A cute dress, shiny shoes, a neat hairdo\u2026 ugh. As you can probably imagine, phrases like \u201cwear skirts, be more feminine, you\u2019re a girl\u201d were the things she kept hearing time and again, until at one point her parents just gave up.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that Jo felt she was ugly or anything, and that being a tomboy was her way of gaining confidence. She actually thinks she\u2019s quite cute, and when she\u2019s forced to be a girly girl she looks no worse than her peers. For her, being a tomboy is a lifestyle, and she\u2019s happy with that. The problem was that some time ago, she\u2019d noticed that her friends had started dating.\n\nOne of the things that people were often mistaken about was the belief that because Jo was a tomboy, she must be gay. But she\u2019s actually attracted to boys, not girls. Ironically, she actually gets a lot of backtalking from girls who say that she\u2019s just trying to get attention from all the boys around her. She\u2019s never taken this seriously, because she\u2019s never had THAT kind of attention from the boys. Which is actually the core of her problem.\n\nYes, she\u2019s seeking her first romance. She has lots of boys around her. So what\u2019s the problem, you might ask. The problem is that they don\u2019t really see her as a girl! They know she\u2019s a girl, of course, but they don\u2019t want to date her, because who would date a bro? Once, there was a boy she liked, and she thought it would be wise to approach him and ask if he wanted to go out with her. And guess what \u2013 he just laughed at her! He wasn\u2019t mean or anything, it was more something like \u201cSorry bro, I don\u2019t see you as a GIRL\u201d. Seeing the look on her face, he corrected himself: \u201cI mean, THAT kind of a girl\u201d. Oh thanks, now that\u2019s much better!\n\nThis was the first time when being a tomboy had a negative effect on her life. She even tried to put on make up and a dress, but felt really weird and the boys just looked at her strange as well. She gave up and lost hope. It seemed like it was a price that she had to pay to keep the comfortable and amusing life of a tomboy. She became a bit melancholic looking at all those happy couples, and felt that something was missing from her life for the first time.\n\nOne day she was invited out to go skateboarding, but she wasn\u2019t in the mood so she just sat there, watching her friends and thinking her sad thoughts. One of her oldest friends soon came over to sit with her and asked why she was so sad. She didn\u2019t want to lie, so she explained everything as it really was \u2013 that no one wanted to date her because no one considered her a potential girlfriend. \u201cDon\u2019t cry\u201d, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll go on a date with you!\u201d She refused out self-respect. \u201cI don\u2019t need charity\u201d, she said. Suddenly, he became very serious and said that he really wanted to. And so she accepted.

By walking a mile in the shoes of his overweight clients, PJ wanted to experience the emotional, psychological and physical effects of obesity, first hand. His 12 month  journey from FIT TO FAT AND BACK shocked the world and brought huge awareness to the obesity epidemic. PJ also inspired countless other trainers to follow in his footsteps and gain weight in order to try and understand the struggles of their overweight clients.
