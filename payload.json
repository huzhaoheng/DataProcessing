The Grinch tells the story of a cynical grump who goes on a mission to steal Christmas, only to have his heart changed by a young girl\u2019s generous holiday spirit.  Funny, heartwarming and visually stunning, it\u2019s a universal story about the spirit of Christmas and the indomitable power of optimism.\n \nAcademy Award\u00ae nominee Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to the infamous Grinch, who lives a solitary life inside a cave on Mt. Crumpet with only his loyal dog, Max, for company.  With a cave rigged with inventions and contraptions for his day-to-day needs, the Grinch only sees his neighbors in Who-ville when he runs out of food.\n \nEach year at Christmas they disrupt his tranquil solitude with their increasingly bigger, brighter and louder celebrations.  When the Whos declare they are going to make Christmas three times bigger this year, the Grinch realizes there is only one way for him to gain some peace and quiet: he must steal Christmas.  To do so, he decides he will pose as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, even going so far as to trap a lackadaisical misfit reindeer to pull his sleigh.\n \nMeanwhile, down in Who-ville, Cindy-Lou Who\u2014a young girl overflowing with holiday cheer\u2014plots with her gang of friends to trap Santa Claus as he makes his Christmas Eve rounds so that she can thank him for help for her overworked single mother.  As Christmas approaches, however, her good-natured scheme threatens to collide with the Grinch\u2019s more nefarious one.  Will Cindy-Lou achieve her goal of finally meeting Santa Claus?  Will the Grinch succeed in silencing the Whos\u2019 holiday cheer once and for all?\n \nFind out, Christmas season 2018.", "Moonshine Jungle Tour 2014 tickets and more info: \nhttp://www.brunomars.com/moonshinejungletour\n\nAvailable now on iTunes! http://smarturl.it/Doo-Wops\n\n\u00a9 2011 WMG.

And it takes us beyond the stars to the far reaches of the universe in search of life somewhere other than Earth.\n\nTo date, astronomers have detected over 3000 planets located outside the solar system. When one thinks that twenty years ago, the only planets we could observe were those in our own solar system, this is both a revolution and a revelation.\n\nWith the construction of giant telescopes, thousands or even millions of other worlds will soon be discovered. These so-called exoplanets are all very different. But could any of them support life? The most recent research shows that life is much more tenacious and resilient than we once thought.\n\nAre we alone in the universe? This question, which for so long was chiefly a religious and philosophical one, has now become rational and scientific. If other inhabited planets exist, how can we detect them? How can we discover what flora, fauna or even what kind of strange civilisations they may host?

Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed.\n\nThis model, known as the nebular hypothesis was first developed in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace. Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy, physics, geology, and planetary science. Since the dawn of the space age in the 1950s and the discovery of extrasolar planets in the 1990s, the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations.\n\nThe Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation. Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets, while other moons are thought to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets. Still others, such as Earth's Moon, may be the result of giant collisions. Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System. The positions of the planets might have shifted due to gravitational interactions. This planetary migration is now thought to have been responsible for much of the Solar System's early evolution.\n\nIn roughly 5 billion years, the Sun will cool and expand outward to many times its current diameter (becoming a red giant), before casting off its outer layers as a planetary nebula and leaving behind a stellar remnant known as a white dwarf. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, others ejected into interstellar space. Ultimately, over the course of tens of billions of years, it is likely that the Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it", "Twitter : https://twitter.com/Blaz_ey_Fear_ey\nIG : https://www.instagram.com/callme_blaze/\nBadge Grinder Twitter: https://twitter.com/2kGrindBadges4U", "Foster The People's \u201cWorst Nites\u201d is available now: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites\n \nAmazon Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/az\nApple Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/applemusic\niTunes: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/itunes\nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/spotify\nYouTube Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/youtubemusic\n \nFollow Foster The People:\nhttp://fosterthepeople.com\nhttp://facebook.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://twitter.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://instagram.com/fosterthepeople\n\nDirectors \u2014 Mark Foster & Josh Hutcherson\nWritten by Josh Hutcherson & Mark Foster\nProduction Company \u2014 Burning Film (burningfilm.com)\nProducer \u2014 Ryland Burns\nCo-Producer - Josh Hutcherson\nCinematographer \u2014 Dannel Escallon\nProduction Designer \u2014 Tyler Evans\nEditor \u2014 John-Michael Powell\nColorist \u2013 Derek Hansen\nCo-Producer \u2014 Christo Arsenio\n1st AD \u2014 Rene Gannon-O\u2019Gara\nWardrobe \u2014 Debbie Gonzalez\nMakeup \u2014 Nikoleta Skarlaty\nCasting \u2014 Jonathan Buckley\nChoreographer \u2014 Chris Scott\n1st AC \u2014 Steve Doyle\n2nd AC \u2014 Ajiri Akpolo\nSteadicam \u2014 Aaron Gantt\nGaffer \u2014 Albert Gonzalez\nKey Grip \u2014 Mark Rodriguez\nGrips \u2014 Dan Martinez, Sergio Nava, & Angel Villarreal\nArt Director \u2014 Craig Smith\nPA \u2014 Eli Paul\n \nStarring \u2014 Richie The Barber, Chris Andrews, Kyle Brown, Stacey Kenealy, Gordana Simunovic, Austin Spacy, & Mark Laursen", "TROLLS (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) out now! \niTunes: http://smarturl.it/Trolls?IQid=dwyt \nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/StreamTrollsOST?IQid=dwyt\nAmazon: http://smarturl.it/TrollsAmz?IQid=dwyt\nGoogle Play: http://smarturl.it/TrollsOSTGP?IQid=dwyt \n\nPhysical copies available at Walmart: http://smarturl.it/TrollsWalmart?IQid=dwyt | Target:http://smarturl.it/TrollsTarget?IQid=dwyt | Best Buy: http://smarturl.it/TrollsBestBuy?IQid=dwyt | FYE:http://smarturl.it/TrollsFYE?IQid=dwyt\n\nFrom the creators of SHREK comes DreamWorks Animation\u2019s TROLLS, a smart, funny and irreverent comedy about the search for happiness, and just how far some will go to get it.  This hilarious film transports audiences to a colorful, wondrous world populated by the overly optimistic Trolls, who have a constant dance in their step and a song on their lips, and the comically pessimistic Bergens, who are only happy when they have trolls in their stomachs.  \n\nAfter the Bergens invade Troll Village, Poppy (Kendrick), the happiest Troll ever born, and the overly-cautious curmudgeonly Branch (Timberlake) set off on a journey to rescue her friends.  Together, this mismatched duo embarks on a rescue mission full of adventure and mishaps \u2013 trying to tolerate each other long enough to get the job done.  \n\nUtilizing music to further the film's narrative, the TROLLS soundtrack is produced by Justin Timberlake and features five original songs including songs by Justin Timberlake, Ariana Grande, Anna Kendrick and Gwen Stefani, in addition to a number of classic hits from the \u201860s through the \u201880s. \n\n\nFollow DreamWorksTV! \ninstagram - https://instagram.com/dreamworkstv/\ntwitter - https://twitter.com/dreamworkstv\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/dreamworkstv\n\nJoin the fun on DreamWorksTV where you can find an endless supply of laugh-out-loud jokes, lovable characters, life hacks, music, magic, gaming and more!

Together they uncover the order\u2019s unholy secret.

The Grinch tells the story of a cynical grump who goes on a mission to steal Christmas, only to have his heart changed by a young girl\u2019s generous holiday spirit.  Funny, heartwarming and visually stunning, it\u2019s a universal story about the spirit of Christmas and the indomitable power of optimism.\n \nAcademy Award\u00ae nominee Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to the infamous Grinch, who lives a solitary life inside a cave on Mt. Crumpet with only his loyal dog, Max, for company.  With a cave rigged with inventions and contraptions for his day-to-day needs, the Grinch only sees his neighbors in Who-ville when he runs out of food.\n \nEach year at Christmas they disrupt his tranquil solitude with their increasingly bigger, brighter and louder celebrations.  When the Whos declare they are going to make Christmas three times bigger this year, the Grinch realizes there is only one way for him to gain some peace and quiet: he must steal Christmas.  To do so, he decides he will pose as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, even going so far as to trap a lackadaisical misfit reindeer to pull his sleigh.\n \nMeanwhile, down in Who-ville, Cindy-Lou Who\u2014a young girl overflowing with holiday cheer\u2014plots with her gang of friends to trap Santa Claus as he makes his Christmas Eve rounds so that she can thank him for help for her overworked single mother.  As Christmas approaches, however, her good-natured scheme threatens to collide with the Grinch\u2019s more nefarious one.  Will Cindy-Lou achieve her goal of finally meeting Santa Claus?  Will the Grinch succeed in silencing the Whos\u2019 holiday cheer once and for all?\n \nFind out, Christmas season 2018.", "Moonshine Jungle Tour 2014 tickets and more info: \nhttp://www.brunomars.com/moonshinejungletour\n\nAvailable now on iTunes! http://smarturl.it/Doo-Wops\n\n\u00a9 2011 WMG.

And it takes us beyond the stars to the far reaches of the universe in search of life somewhere other than Earth.\n\nTo date, astronomers have detected over 3000 planets located outside the solar system. When one thinks that twenty years ago, the only planets we could observe were those in our own solar system, this is both a revolution and a revelation.\n\nWith the construction of giant telescopes, thousands or even millions of other worlds will soon be discovered. These so-called exoplanets are all very different. But could any of them support life? The most recent research shows that life is much more tenacious and resilient than we once thought.\n\nAre we alone in the universe? This question, which for so long was chiefly a religious and philosophical one, has now become rational and scientific. If other inhabited planets exist, how can we detect them? How can we discover what flora, fauna or even what kind of strange civilisations they may host?

Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed.\n\nThis model, known as the nebular hypothesis was first developed in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace. Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy, physics, geology, and planetary science. Since the dawn of the space age in the 1950s and the discovery of extrasolar planets in the 1990s, the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations.\n\nThe Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation. Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets, while other moons are thought to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets. Still others, such as Earth's Moon, may be the result of giant collisions. Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System. The positions of the planets might have shifted due to gravitational interactions. This planetary migration is now thought to have been responsible for much of the Solar System's early evolution.\n\nIn roughly 5 billion years, the Sun will cool and expand outward to many times its current diameter (becoming a red giant), before casting off its outer layers as a planetary nebula and leaving behind a stellar remnant known as a white dwarf. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, others ejected into interstellar space. Ultimately, over the course of tens of billions of years, it is likely that the Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it", "Twitter : https://twitter.com/Blaz_ey_Fear_ey\nIG : https://www.instagram.com/callme_blaze/\nBadge Grinder Twitter: https://twitter.com/2kGrindBadges4U", "Foster The People's \u201cWorst Nites\u201d is available now: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites\n \nAmazon Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/az\nApple Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/applemusic\niTunes: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/itunes\nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/spotify\nYouTube Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/youtubemusic\n \nFollow Foster The People:\nhttp://fosterthepeople.com\nhttp://facebook.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://twitter.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://instagram.com/fosterthepeople\n\nDirectors \u2014 Mark Foster & Josh Hutcherson\nWritten by Josh Hutcherson & Mark Foster\nProduction Company \u2014 Burning Film (burningfilm.com)\nProducer \u2014 Ryland Burns\nCo-Producer - Josh Hutcherson\nCinematographer \u2014 Dannel Escallon\nProduction Designer \u2014 Tyler Evans\nEditor \u2014 John-Michael Powell\nColorist \u2013 Derek Hansen\nCo-Producer \u2014 Christo Arsenio\n1st AD \u2014 Rene Gannon-O\u2019Gara\nWardrobe \u2014 Debbie Gonzalez\nMakeup \u2014 Nikoleta Skarlaty\nCasting \u2014 Jonathan Buckley\nChoreographer \u2014 Chris Scott\n1st AC \u2014 Steve Doyle\n2nd AC \u2014 Ajiri Akpolo\nSteadicam \u2014 Aaron Gantt\nGaffer \u2014 Albert Gonzalez\nKey Grip \u2014 Mark Rodriguez\nGrips \u2014 Dan Martinez, Sergio Nava, & Angel Villarreal\nArt Director \u2014 Craig Smith\nPA \u2014 Eli Paul\n \nStarring \u2014 Richie The Barber, Chris Andrews, Kyle Brown, Stacey Kenealy, Gordana Simunovic, Austin Spacy, & Mark Laursen", "TROLLS (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) out now! \niTunes: http://smarturl.it/Trolls?IQid=dwyt \nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/StreamTrollsOST?IQid=dwyt\nAmazon: http://smarturl.it/TrollsAmz?IQid=dwyt\nGoogle Play: http://smarturl.it/TrollsOSTGP?IQid=dwyt \n\nPhysical copies available at Walmart: http://smarturl.it/TrollsWalmart?IQid=dwyt | Target:http://smarturl.it/TrollsTarget?IQid=dwyt | Best Buy: http://smarturl.it/TrollsBestBuy?IQid=dwyt | FYE:http://smarturl.it/TrollsFYE?IQid=dwyt\n\nFrom the creators of SHREK comes DreamWorks Animation\u2019s TROLLS, a smart, funny and irreverent comedy about the search for happiness, and just how far some will go to get it.  This hilarious film transports audiences to a colorful, wondrous world populated by the overly optimistic Trolls, who have a constant dance in their step and a song on their lips, and the comically pessimistic Bergens, who are only happy when they have trolls in their stomachs.  \n\nAfter the Bergens invade Troll Village, Poppy (Kendrick), the happiest Troll ever born, and the overly-cautious curmudgeonly Branch (Timberlake) set off on a journey to rescue her friends.  Together, this mismatched duo embarks on a rescue mission full of adventure and mishaps \u2013 trying to tolerate each other long enough to get the job done.  \n\nUtilizing music to further the film's narrative, the TROLLS soundtrack is produced by Justin Timberlake and features five original songs including songs by Justin Timberlake, Ariana Grande, Anna Kendrick and Gwen Stefani, in addition to a number of classic hits from the \u201860s through the \u201880s. \n\n\nFollow DreamWorksTV! \ninstagram - https://instagram.com/dreamworkstv/\ntwitter - https://twitter.com/dreamworkstv\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/dreamworkstv\n\nJoin the fun on DreamWorksTV where you can find an endless supply of laugh-out-loud jokes, lovable characters, life hacks, music, magic, gaming and more!

The Grinch tells the story of a cynical grump who goes on a mission to steal Christmas, only to have his heart changed by a young girl\u2019s generous holiday spirit.  Funny, heartwarming and visually stunning, it\u2019s a universal story about the spirit of Christmas and the indomitable power of optimism.\n \nAcademy Award\u00ae nominee Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to the infamous Grinch, who lives a solitary life inside a cave on Mt. Crumpet with only his loyal dog, Max, for company.  With a cave rigged with inventions and contraptions for his day-to-day needs, the Grinch only sees his neighbors in Who-ville when he runs out of food.\n \nEach year at Christmas they disrupt his tranquil solitude with their increasingly bigger, brighter and louder celebrations.  When the Whos declare they are going to make Christmas three times bigger this year, the Grinch realizes there is only one way for him to gain some peace and quiet: he must steal Christmas.  To do so, he decides he will pose as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, even going so far as to trap a lackadaisical misfit reindeer to pull his sleigh.\n \nMeanwhile, down in Who-ville, Cindy-Lou Who\u2014a young girl overflowing with holiday cheer\u2014plots with her gang of friends to trap Santa Claus as he makes his Christmas Eve rounds so that she can thank him for help for her overworked single mother.  As Christmas approaches, however, her good-natured scheme threatens to collide with the Grinch\u2019s more nefarious one.  Will Cindy-Lou achieve her goal of finally meeting Santa Claus?  Will the Grinch succeed in silencing the Whos\u2019 holiday cheer once and for all?\n \nFind out, Christmas season 2018.", "Moonshine Jungle Tour 2014 tickets and more info: \nhttp://www.brunomars.com/moonshinejungletour\n\nAvailable now on iTunes! http://smarturl.it/Doo-Wops\n\n\u00a9 2011 WMG.

And it takes us beyond the stars to the far reaches of the universe in search of life somewhere other than Earth.\n\nTo date, astronomers have detected over 3000 planets located outside the solar system. When one thinks that twenty years ago, the only planets we could observe were those in our own solar system, this is both a revolution and a revelation.\n\nWith the construction of giant telescopes, thousands or even millions of other worlds will soon be discovered. These so-called exoplanets are all very different. But could any of them support life? The most recent research shows that life is much more tenacious and resilient than we once thought.\n\nAre we alone in the universe? This question, which for so long was chiefly a religious and philosophical one, has now become rational and scientific. If other inhabited planets exist, how can we detect them? How can we discover what flora, fauna or even what kind of strange civilisations they may host?

Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed.\n\nThis model, known as the nebular hypothesis was first developed in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace. Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy, physics, geology, and planetary science. Since the dawn of the space age in the 1950s and the discovery of extrasolar planets in the 1990s, the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations.\n\nThe Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation. Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets, while other moons are thought to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets. Still others, such as Earth's Moon, may be the result of giant collisions. Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System. The positions of the planets might have shifted due to gravitational interactions. This planetary migration is now thought to have been responsible for much of the Solar System's early evolution.\n\nIn roughly 5 billion years, the Sun will cool and expand outward to many times its current diameter (becoming a red giant), before casting off its outer layers as a planetary nebula and leaving behind a stellar remnant known as a white dwarf. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, others ejected into interstellar space. Ultimately, over the course of tens of billions of years, it is likely that the Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it", "Twitter : https://twitter.com/Blaz_ey_Fear_ey\nIG : https://www.instagram.com/callme_blaze/\nBadge Grinder Twitter: https://twitter.com/2kGrindBadges4U", "Foster The People's \u201cWorst Nites\u201d is available now: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites\n \nAmazon Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/az\nApple Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/applemusic\niTunes: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/itunes\nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/spotify\nYouTube Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/youtubemusic\n \nFollow Foster The People:\nhttp://fosterthepeople.com\nhttp://facebook.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://twitter.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://instagram.com/fosterthepeople\n\nDirectors \u2014 Mark Foster & Josh Hutcherson\nWritten by Josh Hutcherson & Mark Foster\nProduction Company \u2014 Burning Film (burningfilm.com)\nProducer \u2014 Ryland Burns\nCo-Producer - Josh Hutcherson\nCinematographer \u2014 Dannel Escallon\nProduction Designer \u2014 Tyler Evans\nEditor \u2014 John-Michael Powell\nColorist \u2013 Derek Hansen\nCo-Producer \u2014 Christo Arsenio\n1st AD \u2014 Rene Gannon-O\u2019Gara\nWardrobe \u2014 Debbie Gonzalez\nMakeup \u2014 Nikoleta Skarlaty\nCasting \u2014 Jonathan Buckley\nChoreographer \u2014 Chris Scott\n1st AC \u2014 Steve Doyle\n2nd AC \u2014 Ajiri Akpolo\nSteadicam \u2014 Aaron Gantt\nGaffer \u2014 Albert Gonzalez\nKey Grip \u2014 Mark Rodriguez\nGrips \u2014 Dan Martinez, Sergio Nava, & Angel Villarreal\nArt Director \u2014 Craig Smith\nPA \u2014 Eli Paul\n \nStarring \u2014 Richie The Barber, Chris Andrews, Kyle Brown, Stacey Kenealy, Gordana Simunovic, Austin Spacy, & Mark Laursen", "TROLLS (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) out now! \niTunes: http://smarturl.it/Trolls?IQid=dwyt \nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/StreamTrollsOST?IQid=dwyt\nAmazon: http://smarturl.it/TrollsAmz?IQid=dwyt\nGoogle Play: http://smarturl.it/TrollsOSTGP?IQid=dwyt \n\nPhysical copies available at Walmart: http://smarturl.it/TrollsWalmart?IQid=dwyt | Target:http://smarturl.it/TrollsTarget?IQid=dwyt | Best Buy: http://smarturl.it/TrollsBestBuy?IQid=dwyt | FYE:http://smarturl.it/TrollsFYE?IQid=dwyt\n\nFrom the creators of SHREK comes DreamWorks Animation\u2019s TROLLS, a smart, funny and irreverent comedy about the search for happiness, and just how far some will go to get it.  This hilarious film transports audiences to a colorful, wondrous world populated by the overly optimistic Trolls, who have a constant dance in their step and a song on their lips, and the comically pessimistic Bergens, who are only happy when they have trolls in their stomachs.  \n\nAfter the Bergens invade Troll Village, Poppy (Kendrick), the happiest Troll ever born, and the overly-cautious curmudgeonly Branch (Timberlake) set off on a journey to rescue her friends.  Together, this mismatched duo embarks on a rescue mission full of adventure and mishaps \u2013 trying to tolerate each other long enough to get the job done.  \n\nUtilizing music to further the film's narrative, the TROLLS soundtrack is produced by Justin Timberlake and features five original songs including songs by Justin Timberlake, Ariana Grande, Anna Kendrick and Gwen Stefani, in addition to a number of classic hits from the \u201860s through the \u201880s. \n\n\nFollow DreamWorksTV! \ninstagram - https://instagram.com/dreamworkstv/\ntwitter - https://twitter.com/dreamworkstv\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/dreamworkstv\n\nJoin the fun on DreamWorksTV where you can find an endless supply of laugh-out-loud jokes, lovable characters, life hacks, music, magic, gaming and more!

The Grinch tells the story of a cynical grump who goes on a mission to steal Christmas, only to have his heart changed by a young girl\u2019s generous holiday spirit.  Funny, heartwarming and visually stunning, it\u2019s a universal story about the spirit of Christmas and the indomitable power of optimism.\n \nAcademy Award\u00ae nominee Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to the infamous Grinch, who lives a solitary life inside a cave on Mt. Crumpet with only his loyal dog, Max, for company.  With a cave rigged with inventions and contraptions for his day-to-day needs, the Grinch only sees his neighbors in Who-ville when he runs out of food.\n \nEach year at Christmas they disrupt his tranquil solitude with their increasingly bigger, brighter and louder celebrations.  When the Whos declare they are going to make Christmas three times bigger this year, the Grinch realizes there is only one way for him to gain some peace and quiet: he must steal Christmas.  To do so, he decides he will pose as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, even going so far as to trap a lackadaisical misfit reindeer to pull his sleigh.\n \nMeanwhile, down in Who-ville, Cindy-Lou Who\u2014a young girl overflowing with holiday cheer\u2014plots with her gang of friends to trap Santa Claus as he makes his Christmas Eve rounds so that she can thank him for help for her overworked single mother.  As Christmas approaches, however, her good-natured scheme threatens to collide with the Grinch\u2019s more nefarious one.  Will Cindy-Lou achieve her goal of finally meeting Santa Claus?  Will the Grinch succeed in silencing the Whos\u2019 holiday cheer once and for all?\n \nFind out, Christmas season 2018.", "Moonshine Jungle Tour 2014 tickets and more info: \nhttp://www.brunomars.com/moonshinejungletour\n\nAvailable now on iTunes! http://smarturl.it/Doo-Wops\n\n\u00a9 2011 WMG.

And it takes us beyond the stars to the far reaches of the universe in search of life somewhere other than Earth.\n\nTo date, astronomers have detected over 3000 planets located outside the solar system. When one thinks that twenty years ago, the only planets we could observe were those in our own solar system, this is both a revolution and a revelation.\n\nWith the construction of giant telescopes, thousands or even millions of other worlds will soon be discovered. These so-called exoplanets are all very different. But could any of them support life? The most recent research shows that life is much more tenacious and resilient than we once thought.\n\nAre we alone in the universe? This question, which for so long was chiefly a religious and philosophical one, has now become rational and scientific. If other inhabited planets exist, how can we detect them? How can we discover what flora, fauna or even what kind of strange civilisations they may host?

Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed.\n\nThis model, known as the nebular hypothesis was first developed in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace. Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy, physics, geology, and planetary science. Since the dawn of the space age in the 1950s and the discovery of extrasolar planets in the 1990s, the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations.\n\nThe Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation. Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets, while other moons are thought to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets. Still others, such as Earth's Moon, may be the result of giant collisions. Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System. The positions of the planets might have shifted due to gravitational interactions. This planetary migration is now thought to have been responsible for much of the Solar System's early evolution.\n\nIn roughly 5 billion years, the Sun will cool and expand outward to many times its current diameter (becoming a red giant), before casting off its outer layers as a planetary nebula and leaving behind a stellar remnant known as a white dwarf. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, others ejected into interstellar space. Ultimately, over the course of tens of billions of years, it is likely that the Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it", "Twitter : https://twitter.com/Blaz_ey_Fear_ey\nIG : https://www.instagram.com/callme_blaze/\nBadge Grinder Twitter: https://twitter.com/2kGrindBadges4U", "Foster The People's \u201cWorst Nites\u201d is available now: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites\n \nAmazon Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/az\nApple Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/applemusic\niTunes: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/itunes\nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/spotify\nYouTube Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/youtubemusic\n \nFollow Foster The People:\nhttp://fosterthepeople.com\nhttp://facebook.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://twitter.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://instagram.com/fosterthepeople\n\nDirectors \u2014 Mark Foster & Josh Hutcherson\nWritten by Josh Hutcherson & Mark Foster\nProduction Company \u2014 Burning Film (burningfilm.com)\nProducer \u2014 Ryland Burns\nCo-Producer - Josh Hutcherson\nCinematographer \u2014 Dannel Escallon\nProduction Designer \u2014 Tyler Evans\nEditor \u2014 John-Michael Powell\nColorist \u2013 Derek Hansen\nCo-Producer \u2014 Christo Arsenio\n1st AD \u2014 Rene Gannon-O\u2019Gara\nWardrobe \u2014 Debbie Gonzalez\nMakeup \u2014 Nikoleta Skarlaty\nCasting \u2014 Jonathan Buckley\nChoreographer \u2014 Chris Scott\n1st AC \u2014 Steve Doyle\n2nd AC \u2014 Ajiri Akpolo\nSteadicam \u2014 Aaron Gantt\nGaffer \u2014 Albert Gonzalez\nKey Grip \u2014 Mark Rodriguez\nGrips \u2014 Dan Martinez, Sergio Nava, & Angel Villarreal\nArt Director \u2014 Craig Smith\nPA \u2014 Eli Paul\n \nStarring \u2014 Richie The Barber, Chris Andrews, Kyle Brown, Stacey Kenealy, Gordana Simunovic, Austin Spacy, & Mark Laursen", "TROLLS (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) out now! \niTunes: http://smarturl.it/Trolls?IQid=dwyt \nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/StreamTrollsOST?IQid=dwyt\nAmazon: http://smarturl.it/TrollsAmz?IQid=dwyt\nGoogle Play: http://smarturl.it/TrollsOSTGP?IQid=dwyt \n\nPhysical copies available at Walmart: http://smarturl.it/TrollsWalmart?IQid=dwyt | Target:http://smarturl.it/TrollsTarget?IQid=dwyt | Best Buy: http://smarturl.it/TrollsBestBuy?IQid=dwyt | FYE:http://smarturl.it/TrollsFYE?IQid=dwyt\n\nFrom the creators of SHREK comes DreamWorks Animation\u2019s TROLLS, a smart, funny and irreverent comedy about the search for happiness, and just how far some will go to get it.  This hilarious film transports audiences to a colorful, wondrous world populated by the overly optimistic Trolls, who have a constant dance in their step and a song on their lips, and the comically pessimistic Bergens, who are only happy when they have trolls in their stomachs.  \n\nAfter the Bergens invade Troll Village, Poppy (Kendrick), the happiest Troll ever born, and the overly-cautious curmudgeonly Branch (Timberlake) set off on a journey to rescue her friends.  Together, this mismatched duo embarks on a rescue mission full of adventure and mishaps \u2013 trying to tolerate each other long enough to get the job done.  \n\nUtilizing music to further the film's narrative, the TROLLS soundtrack is produced by Justin Timberlake and features five original songs including songs by Justin Timberlake, Ariana Grande, Anna Kendrick and Gwen Stefani, in addition to a number of classic hits from the \u201860s through the \u201880s. \n\n\nFollow DreamWorksTV! \ninstagram - https://instagram.com/dreamworkstv/\ntwitter - https://twitter.com/dreamworkstv\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/dreamworkstv\n\nJoin the fun on DreamWorksTV where you can find an endless supply of laugh-out-loud jokes, lovable characters, life hacks, music, magic, gaming and more!

The Grinch tells the story of a cynical grump who goes on a mission to steal Christmas, only to have his heart changed by a young girl\u2019s generous holiday spirit.  Funny, heartwarming and visually stunning, it\u2019s a universal story about the spirit of Christmas and the indomitable power of optimism.\n \nAcademy Award\u00ae nominee Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to the infamous Grinch, who lives a solitary life inside a cave on Mt. Crumpet with only his loyal dog, Max, for company.  With a cave rigged with inventions and contraptions for his day-to-day needs, the Grinch only sees his neighbors in Who-ville when he runs out of food.\n \nEach year at Christmas they disrupt his tranquil solitude with their increasingly bigger, brighter and louder celebrations.  When the Whos declare they are going to make Christmas three times bigger this year, the Grinch realizes there is only one way for him to gain some peace and quiet: he must steal Christmas.  To do so, he decides he will pose as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, even going so far as to trap a lackadaisical misfit reindeer to pull his sleigh.\n \nMeanwhile, down in Who-ville, Cindy-Lou Who\u2014a young girl overflowing with holiday cheer\u2014plots with her gang of friends to trap Santa Claus as he makes his Christmas Eve rounds so that she can thank him for help for her overworked single mother.  As Christmas approaches, however, her good-natured scheme threatens to collide with the Grinch\u2019s more nefarious one.  Will Cindy-Lou achieve her goal of finally meeting Santa Claus?  Will the Grinch succeed in silencing the Whos\u2019 holiday cheer once and for all?\n \nFind out, Christmas season 2018.", "Moonshine Jungle Tour 2014 tickets and more info: \nhttp://www.brunomars.com/moonshinejungletour\n\nAvailable now on iTunes! http://smarturl.it/Doo-Wops\n\n\u00a9 2011 WMG.

And it takes us beyond the stars to the far reaches of the universe in search of life somewhere other than Earth.\n\nTo date, astronomers have detected over 3000 planets located outside the solar system. When one thinks that twenty years ago, the only planets we could observe were those in our own solar system, this is both a revolution and a revelation.\n\nWith the construction of giant telescopes, thousands or even millions of other worlds will soon be discovered. These so-called exoplanets are all very different. But could any of them support life? The most recent research shows that life is much more tenacious and resilient than we once thought.\n\nAre we alone in the universe? This question, which for so long was chiefly a religious and philosophical one, has now become rational and scientific. If other inhabited planets exist, how can we detect them? How can we discover what flora, fauna or even what kind of strange civilisations they may host?

Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed.\n\nThis model, known as the nebular hypothesis was first developed in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace. Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy, physics, geology, and planetary science. Since the dawn of the space age in the 1950s and the discovery of extrasolar planets in the 1990s, the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations.\n\nThe Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation. Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets, while other moons are thought to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets. Still others, such as Earth's Moon, may be the result of giant collisions. Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System. The positions of the planets might have shifted due to gravitational interactions. This planetary migration is now thought to have been responsible for much of the Solar System's early evolution.\n\nIn roughly 5 billion years, the Sun will cool and expand outward to many times its current diameter (becoming a red giant), before casting off its outer layers as a planetary nebula and leaving behind a stellar remnant known as a white dwarf. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, others ejected into interstellar space. Ultimately, over the course of tens of billions of years, it is likely that the Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it", "Twitter : https://twitter.com/Blaz_ey_Fear_ey\nIG : https://www.instagram.com/callme_blaze/\nBadge Grinder Twitter: https://twitter.com/2kGrindBadges4U", "Foster The People's \u201cWorst Nites\u201d is available now: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites\n \nAmazon Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/az\nApple Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/applemusic\niTunes: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/itunes\nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/spotify\nYouTube Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/youtubemusic\n \nFollow Foster The People:\nhttp://fosterthepeople.com\nhttp://facebook.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://twitter.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://instagram.com/fosterthepeople\n\nDirectors \u2014 Mark Foster & Josh Hutcherson\nWritten by Josh Hutcherson & Mark Foster\nProduction Company \u2014 Burning Film (burningfilm.com)\nProducer \u2014 Ryland Burns\nCo-Producer - Josh Hutcherson\nCinematographer \u2014 Dannel Escallon\nProduction Designer \u2014 Tyler Evans\nEditor \u2014 John-Michael Powell\nColorist \u2013 Derek Hansen\nCo-Producer \u2014 Christo Arsenio\n1st AD \u2014 Rene Gannon-O\u2019Gara\nWardrobe \u2014 Debbie Gonzalez\nMakeup \u2014 Nikoleta Skarlaty\nCasting \u2014 Jonathan Buckley\nChoreographer \u2014 Chris Scott\n1st AC \u2014 Steve Doyle\n2nd AC \u2014 Ajiri Akpolo\nSteadicam \u2014 Aaron Gantt\nGaffer \u2014 Albert Gonzalez\nKey Grip \u2014 Mark Rodriguez\nGrips \u2014 Dan Martinez, Sergio Nava, & Angel Villarreal\nArt Director \u2014 Craig Smith\nPA \u2014 Eli Paul\n \nStarring \u2014 Richie The Barber, Chris Andrews, Kyle Brown, Stacey Kenealy, Gordana Simunovic, Austin Spacy, & Mark Laursen", "TROLLS (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) out now! \niTunes: http://smarturl.it/Trolls?IQid=dwyt \nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/StreamTrollsOST?IQid=dwyt\nAmazon: http://smarturl.it/TrollsAmz?IQid=dwyt\nGoogle Play: http://smarturl.it/TrollsOSTGP?IQid=dwyt \n\nPhysical copies available at Walmart: http://smarturl.it/TrollsWalmart?IQid=dwyt | Target:http://smarturl.it/TrollsTarget?IQid=dwyt | Best Buy: http://smarturl.it/TrollsBestBuy?IQid=dwyt | FYE:http://smarturl.it/TrollsFYE?IQid=dwyt\n\nFrom the creators of SHREK comes DreamWorks Animation\u2019s TROLLS, a smart, funny and irreverent comedy about the search for happiness, and just how far some will go to get it.  This hilarious film transports audiences to a colorful, wondrous world populated by the overly optimistic Trolls, who have a constant dance in their step and a song on their lips, and the comically pessimistic Bergens, who are only happy when they have trolls in their stomachs.  \n\nAfter the Bergens invade Troll Village, Poppy (Kendrick), the happiest Troll ever born, and the overly-cautious curmudgeonly Branch (Timberlake) set off on a journey to rescue her friends.  Together, this mismatched duo embarks on a rescue mission full of adventure and mishaps \u2013 trying to tolerate each other long enough to get the job done.  \n\nUtilizing music to further the film's narrative, the TROLLS soundtrack is produced by Justin Timberlake and features five original songs including songs by Justin Timberlake, Ariana Grande, Anna Kendrick and Gwen Stefani, in addition to a number of classic hits from the \u201860s through the \u201880s. \n\n\nFollow DreamWorksTV! \ninstagram - https://instagram.com/dreamworkstv/\ntwitter - https://twitter.com/dreamworkstv\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/dreamworkstv\n\nJoin the fun on DreamWorksTV where you can find an endless supply of laugh-out-loud jokes, lovable characters, life hacks, music, magic, gaming and more!

The Grinch tells the story of a cynical grump who goes on a mission to steal Christmas, only to have his heart changed by a young girl\u2019s generous holiday spirit.  Funny, heartwarming and visually stunning, it\u2019s a universal story about the spirit of Christmas and the indomitable power of optimism.\n \nAcademy Award\u00ae nominee Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to the infamous Grinch, who lives a solitary life inside a cave on Mt. Crumpet with only his loyal dog, Max, for company.  With a cave rigged with inventions and contraptions for his day-to-day needs, the Grinch only sees his neighbors in Who-ville when he runs out of food.\n \nEach year at Christmas they disrupt his tranquil solitude with their increasingly bigger, brighter and louder celebrations.  When the Whos declare they are going to make Christmas three times bigger this year, the Grinch realizes there is only one way for him to gain some peace and quiet: he must steal Christmas.  To do so, he decides he will pose as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, even going so far as to trap a lackadaisical misfit reindeer to pull his sleigh.\n \nMeanwhile, down in Who-ville, Cindy-Lou Who\u2014a young girl overflowing with holiday cheer\u2014plots with her gang of friends to trap Santa Claus as he makes his Christmas Eve rounds so that she can thank him for help for her overworked single mother.  As Christmas approaches, however, her good-natured scheme threatens to collide with the Grinch\u2019s more nefarious one.  Will Cindy-Lou achieve her goal of finally meeting Santa Claus?  Will the Grinch succeed in silencing the Whos\u2019 holiday cheer once and for all?\n \nFind out, Christmas season 2018.", "Moonshine Jungle Tour 2014 tickets and more info: \nhttp://www.brunomars.com/moonshinejungletour\n\nAvailable now on iTunes! http://smarturl.it/Doo-Wops\n\n\u00a9 2011 WMG.

And it takes us beyond the stars to the far reaches of the universe in search of life somewhere other than Earth.\n\nTo date, astronomers have detected over 3000 planets located outside the solar system. When one thinks that twenty years ago, the only planets we could observe were those in our own solar system, this is both a revolution and a revelation.\n\nWith the construction of giant telescopes, thousands or even millions of other worlds will soon be discovered. These so-called exoplanets are all very different. But could any of them support life? The most recent research shows that life is much more tenacious and resilient than we once thought.\n\nAre we alone in the universe? This question, which for so long was chiefly a religious and philosophical one, has now become rational and scientific. If other inhabited planets exist, how can we detect them? How can we discover what flora, fauna or even what kind of strange civilisations they may host?

Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed.\n\nThis model, known as the nebular hypothesis was first developed in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace. Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy, physics, geology, and planetary science. Since the dawn of the space age in the 1950s and the discovery of extrasolar planets in the 1990s, the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations.\n\nThe Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation. Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets, while other moons are thought to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets. Still others, such as Earth's Moon, may be the result of giant collisions. Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System. The positions of the planets might have shifted due to gravitational interactions. This planetary migration is now thought to have been responsible for much of the Solar System's early evolution.\n\nIn roughly 5 billion years, the Sun will cool and expand outward to many times its current diameter (becoming a red giant), before casting off its outer layers as a planetary nebula and leaving behind a stellar remnant known as a white dwarf. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, others ejected into interstellar space. Ultimately, over the course of tens of billions of years, it is likely that the Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it", "Twitter : https://twitter.com/Blaz_ey_Fear_ey\nIG : https://www.instagram.com/callme_blaze/\nBadge Grinder Twitter: https://twitter.com/2kGrindBadges4U", "Foster The People's \u201cWorst Nites\u201d is available now: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites\n \nAmazon Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/az\nApple Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/applemusic\niTunes: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/itunes\nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/spotify\nYouTube Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/youtubemusic\n \nFollow Foster The People:\nhttp://fosterthepeople.com\nhttp://facebook.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://twitter.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://instagram.com/fosterthepeople\n\nDirectors \u2014 Mark Foster & Josh Hutcherson\nWritten by Josh Hutcherson & Mark Foster\nProduction Company \u2014 Burning Film (burningfilm.com)\nProducer \u2014 Ryland Burns\nCo-Producer - Josh Hutcherson\nCinematographer \u2014 Dannel Escallon\nProduction Designer \u2014 Tyler Evans\nEditor \u2014 John-Michael Powell\nColorist \u2013 Derek Hansen\nCo-Producer \u2014 Christo Arsenio\n1st AD \u2014 Rene Gannon-O\u2019Gara\nWardrobe \u2014 Debbie Gonzalez\nMakeup \u2014 Nikoleta Skarlaty\nCasting \u2014 Jonathan Buckley\nChoreographer \u2014 Chris Scott\n1st AC \u2014 Steve Doyle\n2nd AC \u2014 Ajiri Akpolo\nSteadicam \u2014 Aaron Gantt\nGaffer \u2014 Albert Gonzalez\nKey Grip \u2014 Mark Rodriguez\nGrips \u2014 Dan Martinez, Sergio Nava, & Angel Villarreal\nArt Director \u2014 Craig Smith\nPA \u2014 Eli Paul\n \nStarring \u2014 Richie The Barber, Chris Andrews, Kyle Brown, Stacey Kenealy, Gordana Simunovic, Austin Spacy, & Mark Laursen", "TROLLS (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) out now! \niTunes: http://smarturl.it/Trolls?IQid=dwyt \nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/StreamTrollsOST?IQid=dwyt\nAmazon: http://smarturl.it/TrollsAmz?IQid=dwyt\nGoogle Play: http://smarturl.it/TrollsOSTGP?IQid=dwyt \n\nPhysical copies available at Walmart: http://smarturl.it/TrollsWalmart?IQid=dwyt | Target:http://smarturl.it/TrollsTarget?IQid=dwyt | Best Buy: http://smarturl.it/TrollsBestBuy?IQid=dwyt | FYE:http://smarturl.it/TrollsFYE?IQid=dwyt\n\nFrom the creators of SHREK comes DreamWorks Animation\u2019s TROLLS, a smart, funny and irreverent comedy about the search for happiness, and just how far some will go to get it.  This hilarious film transports audiences to a colorful, wondrous world populated by the overly optimistic Trolls, who have a constant dance in their step and a song on their lips, and the comically pessimistic Bergens, who are only happy when they have trolls in their stomachs.  \n\nAfter the Bergens invade Troll Village, Poppy (Kendrick), the happiest Troll ever born, and the overly-cautious curmudgeonly Branch (Timberlake) set off on a journey to rescue her friends.  Together, this mismatched duo embarks on a rescue mission full of adventure and mishaps \u2013 trying to tolerate each other long enough to get the job done.  \n\nUtilizing music to further the film's narrative, the TROLLS soundtrack is produced by Justin Timberlake and features five original songs including songs by Justin Timberlake, Ariana Grande, Anna Kendrick and Gwen Stefani, in addition to a number of classic hits from the \u201860s through the \u201880s. \n\n\nFollow DreamWorksTV! \ninstagram - https://instagram.com/dreamworkstv/\ntwitter - https://twitter.com/dreamworkstv\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/dreamworkstv\n\nJoin the fun on DreamWorksTV where you can find an endless supply of laugh-out-loud jokes, lovable characters, life hacks, music, magic, gaming and more!

The Grinch tells the story of a cynical grump who goes on a mission to steal Christmas, only to have his heart changed by a young girl\u2019s generous holiday spirit.  Funny, heartwarming and visually stunning, it\u2019s a universal story about the spirit of Christmas and the indomitable power of optimism.\n \nAcademy Award\u00ae nominee Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to the infamous Grinch, who lives a solitary life inside a cave on Mt. Crumpet with only his loyal dog, Max, for company.  With a cave rigged with inventions and contraptions for his day-to-day needs, the Grinch only sees his neighbors in Who-ville when he runs out of food.\n \nEach year at Christmas they disrupt his tranquil solitude with their increasingly bigger, brighter and louder celebrations.  When the Whos declare they are going to make Christmas three times bigger this year, the Grinch realizes there is only one way for him to gain some peace and quiet: he must steal Christmas.  To do so, he decides he will pose as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, even going so far as to trap a lackadaisical misfit reindeer to pull his sleigh.\n \nMeanwhile, down in Who-ville, Cindy-Lou Who\u2014a young girl overflowing with holiday cheer\u2014plots with her gang of friends to trap Santa Claus as he makes his Christmas Eve rounds so that she can thank him for help for her overworked single mother.  As Christmas approaches, however, her good-natured scheme threatens to collide with the Grinch\u2019s more nefarious one.  Will Cindy-Lou achieve her goal of finally meeting Santa Claus?  Will the Grinch succeed in silencing the Whos\u2019 holiday cheer once and for all?\n \nFind out, Christmas season 2018.", "Moonshine Jungle Tour 2014 tickets and more info: \nhttp://www.brunomars.com/moonshinejungletour\n\nAvailable now on iTunes! http://smarturl.it/Doo-Wops\n\n\u00a9 2011 WMG.

And it takes us beyond the stars to the far reaches of the universe in search of life somewhere other than Earth.\n\nTo date, astronomers have detected over 3000 planets located outside the solar system. When one thinks that twenty years ago, the only planets we could observe were those in our own solar system, this is both a revolution and a revelation.\n\nWith the construction of giant telescopes, thousands or even millions of other worlds will soon be discovered. These so-called exoplanets are all very different. But could any of them support life? The most recent research shows that life is much more tenacious and resilient than we once thought.\n\nAre we alone in the universe? This question, which for so long was chiefly a religious and philosophical one, has now become rational and scientific. If other inhabited planets exist, how can we detect them? How can we discover what flora, fauna or even what kind of strange civilisations they may host?

Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed.\n\nThis model, known as the nebular hypothesis was first developed in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace. Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy, physics, geology, and planetary science. Since the dawn of the space age in the 1950s and the discovery of extrasolar planets in the 1990s, the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations.\n\nThe Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation. Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets, while other moons are thought to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets. Still others, such as Earth's Moon, may be the result of giant collisions. Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System. The positions of the planets might have shifted due to gravitational interactions. This planetary migration is now thought to have been responsible for much of the Solar System's early evolution.\n\nIn roughly 5 billion years, the Sun will cool and expand outward to many times its current diameter (becoming a red giant), before casting off its outer layers as a planetary nebula and leaving behind a stellar remnant known as a white dwarf. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, others ejected into interstellar space. Ultimately, over the course of tens of billions of years, it is likely that the Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it", "Twitter : https://twitter.com/Blaz_ey_Fear_ey\nIG : https://www.instagram.com/callme_blaze/\nBadge Grinder Twitter: https://twitter.com/2kGrindBadges4U", "Foster The People's \u201cWorst Nites\u201d is available now: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites\n \nAmazon Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/az\nApple Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/applemusic\niTunes: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/itunes\nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/spotify\nYouTube Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/youtubemusic\n \nFollow Foster The People:\nhttp://fosterthepeople.com\nhttp://facebook.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://twitter.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://instagram.com/fosterthepeople\n\nDirectors \u2014 Mark Foster & Josh Hutcherson\nWritten by Josh Hutcherson & Mark Foster\nProduction Company \u2014 Burning Film (burningfilm.com)\nProducer \u2014 Ryland Burns\nCo-Producer - Josh Hutcherson\nCinematographer \u2014 Dannel Escallon\nProduction Designer \u2014 Tyler Evans\nEditor \u2014 John-Michael Powell\nColorist \u2013 Derek Hansen\nCo-Producer \u2014 Christo Arsenio\n1st AD \u2014 Rene Gannon-O\u2019Gara\nWardrobe \u2014 Debbie Gonzalez\nMakeup \u2014 Nikoleta Skarlaty\nCasting \u2014 Jonathan Buckley\nChoreographer \u2014 Chris Scott\n1st AC \u2014 Steve Doyle\n2nd AC \u2014 Ajiri Akpolo\nSteadicam \u2014 Aaron Gantt\nGaffer \u2014 Albert Gonzalez\nKey Grip \u2014 Mark Rodriguez\nGrips \u2014 Dan Martinez, Sergio Nava, & Angel Villarreal\nArt Director \u2014 Craig Smith\nPA \u2014 Eli Paul\n \nStarring \u2014 Richie The Barber, Chris Andrews, Kyle Brown, Stacey Kenealy, Gordana Simunovic, Austin Spacy, & Mark Laursen", "TROLLS (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) out now! \niTunes: http://smarturl.it/Trolls?IQid=dwyt \nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/StreamTrollsOST?IQid=dwyt\nAmazon: http://smarturl.it/TrollsAmz?IQid=dwyt\nGoogle Play: http://smarturl.it/TrollsOSTGP?IQid=dwyt \n\nPhysical copies available at Walmart: http://smarturl.it/TrollsWalmart?IQid=dwyt | Target:http://smarturl.it/TrollsTarget?IQid=dwyt | Best Buy: http://smarturl.it/TrollsBestBuy?IQid=dwyt | FYE:http://smarturl.it/TrollsFYE?IQid=dwyt\n\nFrom the creators of SHREK comes DreamWorks Animation\u2019s TROLLS, a smart, funny and irreverent comedy about the search for happiness, and just how far some will go to get it.  This hilarious film transports audiences to a colorful, wondrous world populated by the overly optimistic Trolls, who have a constant dance in their step and a song on their lips, and the comically pessimistic Bergens, who are only happy when they have trolls in their stomachs.  \n\nAfter the Bergens invade Troll Village, Poppy (Kendrick), the happiest Troll ever born, and the overly-cautious curmudgeonly Branch (Timberlake) set off on a journey to rescue her friends.  Together, this mismatched duo embarks on a rescue mission full of adventure and mishaps \u2013 trying to tolerate each other long enough to get the job done.  \n\nUtilizing music to further the film's narrative, the TROLLS soundtrack is produced by Justin Timberlake and features five original songs including songs by Justin Timberlake, Ariana Grande, Anna Kendrick and Gwen Stefani, in addition to a number of classic hits from the \u201860s through the \u201880s. \n\n\nFollow DreamWorksTV! \ninstagram - https://instagram.com/dreamworkstv/\ntwitter - https://twitter.com/dreamworkstv\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/dreamworkstv\n\nJoin the fun on DreamWorksTV where you can find an endless supply of laugh-out-loud jokes, lovable characters, life hacks, music, magic, gaming and more!

The Grinch tells the story of a cynical grump who goes on a mission to steal Christmas, only to have his heart changed by a young girl\u2019s generous holiday spirit.  Funny, heartwarming and visually stunning, it\u2019s a universal story about the spirit of Christmas and the indomitable power of optimism.\n \nAcademy Award\u00ae nominee Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to the infamous Grinch, who lives a solitary life inside a cave on Mt. Crumpet with only his loyal dog, Max, for company.  With a cave rigged with inventions and contraptions for his day-to-day needs, the Grinch only sees his neighbors in Who-ville when he runs out of food.\n \nEach year at Christmas they disrupt his tranquil solitude with their increasingly bigger, brighter and louder celebrations.  When the Whos declare they are going to make Christmas three times bigger this year, the Grinch realizes there is only one way for him to gain some peace and quiet: he must steal Christmas.  To do so, he decides he will pose as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, even going so far as to trap a lackadaisical misfit reindeer to pull his sleigh.\n \nMeanwhile, down in Who-ville, Cindy-Lou Who\u2014a young girl overflowing with holiday cheer\u2014plots with her gang of friends to trap Santa Claus as he makes his Christmas Eve rounds so that she can thank him for help for her overworked single mother.  As Christmas approaches, however, her good-natured scheme threatens to collide with the Grinch\u2019s more nefarious one.  Will Cindy-Lou achieve her goal of finally meeting Santa Claus?  Will the Grinch succeed in silencing the Whos\u2019 holiday cheer once and for all?\n \nFind out, Christmas season 2018.", "Moonshine Jungle Tour 2014 tickets and more info: \nhttp://www.brunomars.com/moonshinejungletour\n\nAvailable now on iTunes! http://smarturl.it/Doo-Wops\n\n\u00a9 2011 WMG.

And it takes us beyond the stars to the far reaches of the universe in search of life somewhere other than Earth.\n\nTo date, astronomers have detected over 3000 planets located outside the solar system. When one thinks that twenty years ago, the only planets we could observe were those in our own solar system, this is both a revolution and a revelation.\n\nWith the construction of giant telescopes, thousands or even millions of other worlds will soon be discovered. These so-called exoplanets are all very different. But could any of them support life? The most recent research shows that life is much more tenacious and resilient than we once thought.\n\nAre we alone in the universe? This question, which for so long was chiefly a religious and philosophical one, has now become rational and scientific. If other inhabited planets exist, how can we detect them? How can we discover what flora, fauna or even what kind of strange civilisations they may host?

Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed.\n\nThis model, known as the nebular hypothesis was first developed in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace. Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy, physics, geology, and planetary science. Since the dawn of the space age in the 1950s and the discovery of extrasolar planets in the 1990s, the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations.\n\nThe Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation. Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets, while other moons are thought to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets. Still others, such as Earth's Moon, may be the result of giant collisions. Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System. The positions of the planets might have shifted due to gravitational interactions. This planetary migration is now thought to have been responsible for much of the Solar System's early evolution.\n\nIn roughly 5 billion years, the Sun will cool and expand outward to many times its current diameter (becoming a red giant), before casting off its outer layers as a planetary nebula and leaving behind a stellar remnant known as a white dwarf. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, others ejected into interstellar space. Ultimately, over the course of tens of billions of years, it is likely that the Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it", "Twitter : https://twitter.com/Blaz_ey_Fear_ey\nIG : https://www.instagram.com/callme_blaze/\nBadge Grinder Twitter: https://twitter.com/2kGrindBadges4U", "Foster The People's \u201cWorst Nites\u201d is available now: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites\n \nAmazon Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/az\nApple Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/applemusic\niTunes: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/itunes\nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/spotify\nYouTube Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/youtubemusic\n \nFollow Foster The People:\nhttp://fosterthepeople.com\nhttp://facebook.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://twitter.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://instagram.com/fosterthepeople\n\nDirectors \u2014 Mark Foster & Josh Hutcherson\nWritten by Josh Hutcherson & Mark Foster\nProduction Company \u2014 Burning Film (burningfilm.com)\nProducer \u2014 Ryland Burns\nCo-Producer - Josh Hutcherson\nCinematographer \u2014 Dannel Escallon\nProduction Designer \u2014 Tyler Evans\nEditor \u2014 John-Michael Powell\nColorist \u2013 Derek Hansen\nCo-Producer \u2014 Christo Arsenio\n1st AD \u2014 Rene Gannon-O\u2019Gara\nWardrobe \u2014 Debbie Gonzalez\nMakeup \u2014 Nikoleta Skarlaty\nCasting \u2014 Jonathan Buckley\nChoreographer \u2014 Chris Scott\n1st AC \u2014 Steve Doyle\n2nd AC \u2014 Ajiri Akpolo\nSteadicam \u2014 Aaron Gantt\nGaffer \u2014 Albert Gonzalez\nKey Grip \u2014 Mark Rodriguez\nGrips \u2014 Dan Martinez, Sergio Nava, & Angel Villarreal\nArt Director \u2014 Craig Smith\nPA \u2014 Eli Paul\n \nStarring \u2014 Richie The Barber, Chris Andrews, Kyle Brown, Stacey Kenealy, Gordana Simunovic, Austin Spacy, & Mark Laursen", "TROLLS (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) out now! \niTunes: http://smarturl.it/Trolls?IQid=dwyt \nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/StreamTrollsOST?IQid=dwyt\nAmazon: http://smarturl.it/TrollsAmz?IQid=dwyt\nGoogle Play: http://smarturl.it/TrollsOSTGP?IQid=dwyt \n\nPhysical copies available at Walmart: http://smarturl.it/TrollsWalmart?IQid=dwyt | Target:http://smarturl.it/TrollsTarget?IQid=dwyt | Best Buy: http://smarturl.it/TrollsBestBuy?IQid=dwyt | FYE:http://smarturl.it/TrollsFYE?IQid=dwyt\n\nFrom the creators of SHREK comes DreamWorks Animation\u2019s TROLLS, a smart, funny and irreverent comedy about the search for happiness, and just how far some will go to get it.  This hilarious film transports audiences to a colorful, wondrous world populated by the overly optimistic Trolls, who have a constant dance in their step and a song on their lips, and the comically pessimistic Bergens, who are only happy when they have trolls in their stomachs.  \n\nAfter the Bergens invade Troll Village, Poppy (Kendrick), the happiest Troll ever born, and the overly-cautious curmudgeonly Branch (Timberlake) set off on a journey to rescue her friends.  Together, this mismatched duo embarks on a rescue mission full of adventure and mishaps \u2013 trying to tolerate each other long enough to get the job done.  \n\nUtilizing music to further the film's narrative, the TROLLS soundtrack is produced by Justin Timberlake and features five original songs including songs by Justin Timberlake, Ariana Grande, Anna Kendrick and Gwen Stefani, in addition to a number of classic hits from the \u201860s through the \u201880s. \n\n\nFollow DreamWorksTV! \ninstagram - https://instagram.com/dreamworkstv/\ntwitter - https://twitter.com/dreamworkstv\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/dreamworkstv\n\nJoin the fun on DreamWorksTV where you can find an endless supply of laugh-out-loud jokes, lovable characters, life hacks, music, magic, gaming and more!

The Grinch tells the story of a cynical grump who goes on a mission to steal Christmas, only to have his heart changed by a young girl\u2019s generous holiday spirit.  Funny, heartwarming and visually stunning, it\u2019s a universal story about the spirit of Christmas and the indomitable power of optimism.\n \nAcademy Award\u00ae nominee Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to the infamous Grinch, who lives a solitary life inside a cave on Mt. Crumpet with only his loyal dog, Max, for company.  With a cave rigged with inventions and contraptions for his day-to-day needs, the Grinch only sees his neighbors in Who-ville when he runs out of food.\n \nEach year at Christmas they disrupt his tranquil solitude with their increasingly bigger, brighter and louder celebrations.  When the Whos declare they are going to make Christmas three times bigger this year, the Grinch realizes there is only one way for him to gain some peace and quiet: he must steal Christmas.  To do so, he decides he will pose as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, even going so far as to trap a lackadaisical misfit reindeer to pull his sleigh.\n \nMeanwhile, down in Who-ville, Cindy-Lou Who\u2014a young girl overflowing with holiday cheer\u2014plots with her gang of friends to trap Santa Claus as he makes his Christmas Eve rounds so that she can thank him for help for her overworked single mother.  As Christmas approaches, however, her good-natured scheme threatens to collide with the Grinch\u2019s more nefarious one.  Will Cindy-Lou achieve her goal of finally meeting Santa Claus?  Will the Grinch succeed in silencing the Whos\u2019 holiday cheer once and for all?\n \nFind out, Christmas season 2018.", "Moonshine Jungle Tour 2014 tickets and more info: \nhttp://www.brunomars.com/moonshinejungletour\n\nAvailable now on iTunes! http://smarturl.it/Doo-Wops\n\n\u00a9 2011 WMG.

And it takes us beyond the stars to the far reaches of the universe in search of life somewhere other than Earth.\n\nTo date, astronomers have detected over 3000 planets located outside the solar system. When one thinks that twenty years ago, the only planets we could observe were those in our own solar system, this is both a revolution and a revelation.\n\nWith the construction of giant telescopes, thousands or even millions of other worlds will soon be discovered. These so-called exoplanets are all very different. But could any of them support life? The most recent research shows that life is much more tenacious and resilient than we once thought.\n\nAre we alone in the universe? This question, which for so long was chiefly a religious and philosophical one, has now become rational and scientific. If other inhabited planets exist, how can we detect them? How can we discover what flora, fauna or even what kind of strange civilisations they may host?

Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed.\n\nThis model, known as the nebular hypothesis was first developed in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace. Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy, physics, geology, and planetary science. Since the dawn of the space age in the 1950s and the discovery of extrasolar planets in the 1990s, the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations.\n\nThe Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation. Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets, while other moons are thought to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets. Still others, such as Earth's Moon, may be the result of giant collisions. Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System. The positions of the planets might have shifted due to gravitational interactions. This planetary migration is now thought to have been responsible for much of the Solar System's early evolution.\n\nIn roughly 5 billion years, the Sun will cool and expand outward to many times its current diameter (becoming a red giant), before casting off its outer layers as a planetary nebula and leaving behind a stellar remnant known as a white dwarf. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, others ejected into interstellar space. Ultimately, over the course of tens of billions of years, it is likely that the Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it", "Twitter : https://twitter.com/Blaz_ey_Fear_ey\nIG : https://www.instagram.com/callme_blaze/\nBadge Grinder Twitter: https://twitter.com/2kGrindBadges4U", "Foster The People's \u201cWorst Nites\u201d is available now: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites\n \nAmazon Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/az\nApple Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/applemusic\niTunes: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/itunes\nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/spotify\nYouTube Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/youtubemusic\n \nFollow Foster The People:\nhttp://fosterthepeople.com\nhttp://facebook.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://twitter.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://instagram.com/fosterthepeople\n\nDirectors \u2014 Mark Foster & Josh Hutcherson\nWritten by Josh Hutcherson & Mark Foster\nProduction Company \u2014 Burning Film (burningfilm.com)\nProducer \u2014 Ryland Burns\nCo-Producer - Josh Hutcherson\nCinematographer \u2014 Dannel Escallon\nProduction Designer \u2014 Tyler Evans\nEditor \u2014 John-Michael Powell\nColorist \u2013 Derek Hansen\nCo-Producer \u2014 Christo Arsenio\n1st AD \u2014 Rene Gannon-O\u2019Gara\nWardrobe \u2014 Debbie Gonzalez\nMakeup \u2014 Nikoleta Skarlaty\nCasting \u2014 Jonathan Buckley\nChoreographer \u2014 Chris Scott\n1st AC \u2014 Steve Doyle\n2nd AC \u2014 Ajiri Akpolo\nSteadicam \u2014 Aaron Gantt\nGaffer \u2014 Albert Gonzalez\nKey Grip \u2014 Mark Rodriguez\nGrips \u2014 Dan Martinez, Sergio Nava, & Angel Villarreal\nArt Director \u2014 Craig Smith\nPA \u2014 Eli Paul\n \nStarring \u2014 Richie The Barber, Chris Andrews, Kyle Brown, Stacey Kenealy, Gordana Simunovic, Austin Spacy, & Mark Laursen", "TROLLS (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) out now! \niTunes: http://smarturl.it/Trolls?IQid=dwyt \nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/StreamTrollsOST?IQid=dwyt\nAmazon: http://smarturl.it/TrollsAmz?IQid=dwyt\nGoogle Play: http://smarturl.it/TrollsOSTGP?IQid=dwyt \n\nPhysical copies available at Walmart: http://smarturl.it/TrollsWalmart?IQid=dwyt | Target:http://smarturl.it/TrollsTarget?IQid=dwyt | Best Buy: http://smarturl.it/TrollsBestBuy?IQid=dwyt | FYE:http://smarturl.it/TrollsFYE?IQid=dwyt\n\nFrom the creators of SHREK comes DreamWorks Animation\u2019s TROLLS, a smart, funny and irreverent comedy about the search for happiness, and just how far some will go to get it.  This hilarious film transports audiences to a colorful, wondrous world populated by the overly optimistic Trolls, who have a constant dance in their step and a song on their lips, and the comically pessimistic Bergens, who are only happy when they have trolls in their stomachs.  \n\nAfter the Bergens invade Troll Village, Poppy (Kendrick), the happiest Troll ever born, and the overly-cautious curmudgeonly Branch (Timberlake) set off on a journey to rescue her friends.  Together, this mismatched duo embarks on a rescue mission full of adventure and mishaps \u2013 trying to tolerate each other long enough to get the job done.  \n\nUtilizing music to further the film's narrative, the TROLLS soundtrack is produced by Justin Timberlake and features five original songs including songs by Justin Timberlake, Ariana Grande, Anna Kendrick and Gwen Stefani, in addition to a number of classic hits from the \u201860s through the \u201880s. \n\n\nFollow DreamWorksTV! \ninstagram - https://instagram.com/dreamworkstv/\ntwitter - https://twitter.com/dreamworkstv\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/dreamworkstv\n\nJoin the fun on DreamWorksTV where you can find an endless supply of laugh-out-loud jokes, lovable characters, life hacks, music, magic, gaming and more!

The Grinch tells the story of a cynical grump who goes on a mission to steal Christmas, only to have his heart changed by a young girl\u2019s generous holiday spirit.  Funny, heartwarming and visually stunning, it\u2019s a universal story about the spirit of Christmas and the indomitable power of optimism.\n \nAcademy Award\u00ae nominee Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to the infamous Grinch, who lives a solitary life inside a cave on Mt. Crumpet with only his loyal dog, Max, for company.  With a cave rigged with inventions and contraptions for his day-to-day needs, the Grinch only sees his neighbors in Who-ville when he runs out of food.\n \nEach year at Christmas they disrupt his tranquil solitude with their increasingly bigger, brighter and louder celebrations.  When the Whos declare they are going to make Christmas three times bigger this year, the Grinch realizes there is only one way for him to gain some peace and quiet: he must steal Christmas.  To do so, he decides he will pose as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, even going so far as to trap a lackadaisical misfit reindeer to pull his sleigh.\n \nMeanwhile, down in Who-ville, Cindy-Lou Who\u2014a young girl overflowing with holiday cheer\u2014plots with her gang of friends to trap Santa Claus as he makes his Christmas Eve rounds so that she can thank him for help for her overworked single mother.  As Christmas approaches, however, her good-natured scheme threatens to collide with the Grinch\u2019s more nefarious one.  Will Cindy-Lou achieve her goal of finally meeting Santa Claus?  Will the Grinch succeed in silencing the Whos\u2019 holiday cheer once and for all?\n \nFind out, Christmas season 2018.", "Moonshine Jungle Tour 2014 tickets and more info: \nhttp://www.brunomars.com/moonshinejungletour\n\nAvailable now on iTunes! http://smarturl.it/Doo-Wops\n\n\u00a9 2011 WMG.

And it takes us beyond the stars to the far reaches of the universe in search of life somewhere other than Earth.\n\nTo date, astronomers have detected over 3000 planets located outside the solar system. When one thinks that twenty years ago, the only planets we could observe were those in our own solar system, this is both a revolution and a revelation.\n\nWith the construction of giant telescopes, thousands or even millions of other worlds will soon be discovered. These so-called exoplanets are all very different. But could any of them support life? The most recent research shows that life is much more tenacious and resilient than we once thought.\n\nAre we alone in the universe? This question, which for so long was chiefly a religious and philosophical one, has now become rational and scientific. If other inhabited planets exist, how can we detect them? How can we discover what flora, fauna or even what kind of strange civilisations they may host?

Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed.\n\nThis model, known as the nebular hypothesis was first developed in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace. Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy, physics, geology, and planetary science. Since the dawn of the space age in the 1950s and the discovery of extrasolar planets in the 1990s, the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations.\n\nThe Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation. Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets, while other moons are thought to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets. Still others, such as Earth's Moon, may be the result of giant collisions. Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System. The positions of the planets might have shifted due to gravitational interactions. This planetary migration is now thought to have been responsible for much of the Solar System's early evolution.\n\nIn roughly 5 billion years, the Sun will cool and expand outward to many times its current diameter (becoming a red giant), before casting off its outer layers as a planetary nebula and leaving behind a stellar remnant known as a white dwarf. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, others ejected into interstellar space. Ultimately, over the course of tens of billions of years, it is likely that the Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it", "Twitter : https://twitter.com/Blaz_ey_Fear_ey\nIG : https://www.instagram.com/callme_blaze/\nBadge Grinder Twitter: https://twitter.com/2kGrindBadges4U", "Foster The People's \u201cWorst Nites\u201d is available now: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites\n \nAmazon Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/az\nApple Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/applemusic\niTunes: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/itunes\nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/spotify\nYouTube Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/youtubemusic\n \nFollow Foster The People:\nhttp://fosterthepeople.com\nhttp://facebook.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://twitter.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://instagram.com/fosterthepeople\n\nDirectors \u2014 Mark Foster & Josh Hutcherson\nWritten by Josh Hutcherson & Mark Foster\nProduction Company \u2014 Burning Film (burningfilm.com)\nProducer \u2014 Ryland Burns\nCo-Producer - Josh Hutcherson\nCinematographer \u2014 Dannel Escallon\nProduction Designer \u2014 Tyler Evans\nEditor \u2014 John-Michael Powell\nColorist \u2013 Derek Hansen\nCo-Producer \u2014 Christo Arsenio\n1st AD \u2014 Rene Gannon-O\u2019Gara\nWardrobe \u2014 Debbie Gonzalez\nMakeup \u2014 Nikoleta Skarlaty\nCasting \u2014 Jonathan Buckley\nChoreographer \u2014 Chris Scott\n1st AC \u2014 Steve Doyle\n2nd AC \u2014 Ajiri Akpolo\nSteadicam \u2014 Aaron Gantt\nGaffer \u2014 Albert Gonzalez\nKey Grip \u2014 Mark Rodriguez\nGrips \u2014 Dan Martinez, Sergio Nava, & Angel Villarreal\nArt Director \u2014 Craig Smith\nPA \u2014 Eli Paul\n \nStarring \u2014 Richie The Barber, Chris Andrews, Kyle Brown, Stacey Kenealy, Gordana Simunovic, Austin Spacy, & Mark Laursen", "TROLLS (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) out now! \niTunes: http://smarturl.it/Trolls?IQid=dwyt \nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/StreamTrollsOST?IQid=dwyt\nAmazon: http://smarturl.it/TrollsAmz?IQid=dwyt\nGoogle Play: http://smarturl.it/TrollsOSTGP?IQid=dwyt \n\nPhysical copies available at Walmart: http://smarturl.it/TrollsWalmart?IQid=dwyt | Target:http://smarturl.it/TrollsTarget?IQid=dwyt | Best Buy: http://smarturl.it/TrollsBestBuy?IQid=dwyt | FYE:http://smarturl.it/TrollsFYE?IQid=dwyt\n\nFrom the creators of SHREK comes DreamWorks Animation\u2019s TROLLS, a smart, funny and irreverent comedy about the search for happiness, and just how far some will go to get it.  This hilarious film transports audiences to a colorful, wondrous world populated by the overly optimistic Trolls, who have a constant dance in their step and a song on their lips, and the comically pessimistic Bergens, who are only happy when they have trolls in their stomachs.  \n\nAfter the Bergens invade Troll Village, Poppy (Kendrick), the happiest Troll ever born, and the overly-cautious curmudgeonly Branch (Timberlake) set off on a journey to rescue her friends.  Together, this mismatched duo embarks on a rescue mission full of adventure and mishaps \u2013 trying to tolerate each other long enough to get the job done.  \n\nUtilizing music to further the film's narrative, the TROLLS soundtrack is produced by Justin Timberlake and features five original songs including songs by Justin Timberlake, Ariana Grande, Anna Kendrick and Gwen Stefani, in addition to a number of classic hits from the \u201860s through the \u201880s. \n\n\nFollow DreamWorksTV! \ninstagram - https://instagram.com/dreamworkstv/\ntwitter - https://twitter.com/dreamworkstv\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/dreamworkstv\n\nJoin the fun on DreamWorksTV where you can find an endless supply of laugh-out-loud jokes, lovable characters, life hacks, music, magic, gaming and more!

The Grinch tells the story of a cynical grump who goes on a mission to steal Christmas, only to have his heart changed by a young girl\u2019s generous holiday spirit.  Funny, heartwarming and visually stunning, it\u2019s a universal story about the spirit of Christmas and the indomitable power of optimism.\n \nAcademy Award\u00ae nominee Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to the infamous Grinch, who lives a solitary life inside a cave on Mt. Crumpet with only his loyal dog, Max, for company.  With a cave rigged with inventions and contraptions for his day-to-day needs, the Grinch only sees his neighbors in Who-ville when he runs out of food.\n \nEach year at Christmas they disrupt his tranquil solitude with their increasingly bigger, brighter and louder celebrations.  When the Whos declare they are going to make Christmas three times bigger this year, the Grinch realizes there is only one way for him to gain some peace and quiet: he must steal Christmas.  To do so, he decides he will pose as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, even going so far as to trap a lackadaisical misfit reindeer to pull his sleigh.\n \nMeanwhile, down in Who-ville, Cindy-Lou Who\u2014a young girl overflowing with holiday cheer\u2014plots with her gang of friends to trap Santa Claus as he makes his Christmas Eve rounds so that she can thank him for help for her overworked single mother.  As Christmas approaches, however, her good-natured scheme threatens to collide with the Grinch\u2019s more nefarious one.  Will Cindy-Lou achieve her goal of finally meeting Santa Claus?  Will the Grinch succeed in silencing the Whos\u2019 holiday cheer once and for all?\n \nFind out, Christmas season 2018.", "Moonshine Jungle Tour 2014 tickets and more info: \nhttp://www.brunomars.com/moonshinejungletour\n\nAvailable now on iTunes! http://smarturl.it/Doo-Wops\n\n\u00a9 2011 WMG.

And it takes us beyond the stars to the far reaches of the universe in search of life somewhere other than Earth.\n\nTo date, astronomers have detected over 3000 planets located outside the solar system. When one thinks that twenty years ago, the only planets we could observe were those in our own solar system, this is both a revolution and a revelation.\n\nWith the construction of giant telescopes, thousands or even millions of other worlds will soon be discovered. These so-called exoplanets are all very different. But could any of them support life? The most recent research shows that life is much more tenacious and resilient than we once thought.\n\nAre we alone in the universe? This question, which for so long was chiefly a religious and philosophical one, has now become rational and scientific. If other inhabited planets exist, how can we detect them? How can we discover what flora, fauna or even what kind of strange civilisations they may host? And above all, how do we get there?\n\nThis documentary offers secondary science teachers stimulus materials to help students to imagine the future possibility of humans making an as-yet impossible voyage into the cosmos in search of the life forms that might be found there. Search for Second Earth explores a voyage into the infinite, which will also teach us a great deal about our own planet and the origins of life here.", "Bounce along in the bus all over town with this favorite nursery rhyme!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/Cocomelon?sub_confirmation=1\nWEBSITE: http://www.Cocomelon.com\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/Cocomelonkids/\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/Cocomelonkids\n\nJJ, YoYo, and TomTom are happy to say ABCkidTV has a new name - it\u2019s \u201cCocomelon\u201d!

Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed.\n\nThis model, known as the nebular hypothesis was first developed in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace. Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy, physics, geology, and planetary science. Since the dawn of the space age in the 1950s and the discovery of extrasolar planets in the 1990s, the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations.\n\nThe Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation. Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets, while other moons are thought to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets. Still others, such as Earth's Moon, may be the result of giant collisions. Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System. The positions of the planets might have shifted due to gravitational interactions. This planetary migration is now thought to have been responsible for much of the Solar System's early evolution.\n\nIn roughly 5 billion years, the Sun will cool and expand outward to many times its current diameter (becoming a red giant), before casting off its outer layers as a planetary nebula and leaving behind a stellar remnant known as a white dwarf. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, others ejected into interstellar space. Ultimately, over the course of tens of billions of years, it is likely that the Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it", "Twitter : https://twitter.com/Blaz_ey_Fear_ey\nIG : https://www.instagram.com/callme_blaze/\nBadge Grinder Twitter: https://twitter.com/2kGrindBadges4U", "Foster The People's \u201cWorst Nites\u201d is available now: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites\n \nAmazon Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/az\nApple Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/applemusic\niTunes: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/itunes\nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/spotify\nYouTube Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/youtubemusic\n \nFollow Foster The People:\nhttp://fosterthepeople.com\nhttp://facebook.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://twitter.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://instagram.com/fosterthepeople\n\nDirectors \u2014 Mark Foster & Josh Hutcherson\nWritten by Josh Hutcherson & Mark Foster\nProduction Company \u2014 Burning Film (burningfilm.com)\nProducer \u2014 Ryland Burns\nCo-Producer - Josh Hutcherson\nCinematographer \u2014 Dannel Escallon\nProduction Designer \u2014 Tyler Evans\nEditor \u2014 John-Michael Powell\nColorist \u2013 Derek Hansen\nCo-Producer \u2014 Christo Arsenio\n1st AD \u2014 Rene Gannon-O\u2019Gara\nWardrobe \u2014 Debbie Gonzalez\nMakeup \u2014 Nikoleta Skarlaty\nCasting \u2014 Jonathan Buckley\nChoreographer \u2014 Chris Scott\n1st AC \u2014 Steve Doyle\n2nd AC \u2014 Ajiri Akpolo\nSteadicam \u2014 Aaron Gantt\nGaffer \u2014 Albert Gonzalez\nKey Grip \u2014 Mark Rodriguez\nGrips \u2014 Dan Martinez, Sergio Nava, & Angel Villarreal\nArt Director \u2014 Craig Smith\nPA \u2014 Eli Paul\n \nStarring \u2014 Richie The Barber, Chris Andrews, Kyle Brown, Stacey Kenealy, Gordana Simunovic, Austin Spacy, & Mark Laursen", "TROLLS (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) out now! \niTunes: http://smarturl.it/Trolls?IQid=dwyt \nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/StreamTrollsOST?IQid=dwyt\nAmazon: http://smarturl.it/TrollsAmz?IQid=dwyt\nGoogle Play: http://smarturl.it/TrollsOSTGP?IQid=dwyt \n\nPhysical copies available at Walmart: http://smarturl.it/TrollsWalmart?IQid=dwyt | Target:http://smarturl.it/TrollsTarget?IQid=dwyt | Best Buy: http://smarturl.it/TrollsBestBuy?IQid=dwyt | FYE:http://smarturl.it/TrollsFYE?IQid=dwyt\n\nFrom the creators of SHREK comes DreamWorks Animation\u2019s TROLLS, a smart, funny and irreverent comedy about the search for happiness, and just how far some will go to get it.  This hilarious film transports audiences to a colorful, wondrous world populated by the overly optimistic Trolls, who have a constant dance in their step and a song on their lips, and the comically pessimistic Bergens, who are only happy when they have trolls in their stomachs.  \n\nAfter the Bergens invade Troll Village, Poppy (Kendrick), the happiest Troll ever born, and the overly-cautious curmudgeonly Branch (Timberlake) set off on a journey to rescue her friends.  Together, this mismatched duo embarks on a rescue mission full of adventure and mishaps \u2013 trying to tolerate each other long enough to get the job done.  \n\nUtilizing music to further the film's narrative, the TROLLS soundtrack is produced by Justin Timberlake and features five original songs including songs by Justin Timberlake, Ariana Grande, Anna Kendrick and Gwen Stefani, in addition to a number of classic hits from the \u201860s through the \u201880s. \n\n\nFollow DreamWorksTV! \ninstagram - https://instagram.com/dreamworkstv/\ntwitter - https://twitter.com/dreamworkstv\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/dreamworkstv\n\nJoin the fun on DreamWorksTV where you can find an endless supply of laugh-out-loud jokes, lovable characters, life hacks, music, magic, gaming and more!

The Grinch tells the story of a cynical grump who goes on a mission to steal Christmas, only to have his heart changed by a young girl\u2019s generous holiday spirit.  Funny, heartwarming and visually stunning, it\u2019s a universal story about the spirit of Christmas and the indomitable power of optimism.\n \nAcademy Award\u00ae nominee Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to the infamous Grinch, who lives a solitary life inside a cave on Mt. Crumpet with only his loyal dog, Max, for company.  With a cave rigged with inventions and contraptions for his day-to-day needs, the Grinch only sees his neighbors in Who-ville when he runs out of food.\n \nEach year at Christmas they disrupt his tranquil solitude with their increasingly bigger, brighter and louder celebrations.  When the Whos declare they are going to make Christmas three times bigger this year, the Grinch realizes there is only one way for him to gain some peace and quiet: he must steal Christmas.  To do so, he decides he will pose as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, even going so far as to trap a lackadaisical misfit reindeer to pull his sleigh.\n \nMeanwhile, down in Who-ville, Cindy-Lou Who\u2014a young girl overflowing with holiday cheer\u2014plots with her gang of friends to trap Santa Claus as he makes his Christmas Eve rounds so that she can thank him for help for her overworked single mother.  As Christmas approaches, however, her good-natured scheme threatens to collide with the Grinch\u2019s more nefarious one.  Will Cindy-Lou achieve her goal of finally meeting Santa Claus?  Will the Grinch succeed in silencing the Whos\u2019 holiday cheer once and for all?\n \nFind out, Christmas season 2018.", "Moonshine Jungle Tour 2014 tickets and more info: \nhttp://www.brunomars.com/moonshinejungletour\n\nAvailable now on iTunes! http://smarturl.it/Doo-Wops\n\n\u00a9 2011 WMG.

And it takes us beyond the stars to the far reaches of the universe in search of life somewhere other than Earth.\n\nTo date, astronomers have detected over 3000 planets located outside the solar system. When one thinks that twenty years ago, the only planets we could observe were those in our own solar system, this is both a revolution and a revelation.\n\nWith the construction of giant telescopes, thousands or even millions of other worlds will soon be discovered. These so-called exoplanets are all very different. But could any of them support life? The most recent research shows that life is much more tenacious and resilient than we once thought.\n\nAre we alone in the universe? This question, which for so long was chiefly a religious and philosophical one, has now become rational and scientific. If other inhabited planets exist, how can we detect them? How can we discover what flora, fauna or even what kind of strange civilisations they may host? And above all, how do we get there?\n\nThis documentary offers secondary science teachers stimulus materials to help students to imagine the future possibility of humans making an as-yet impossible voyage into the cosmos in search of the life forms that might be found there. Search for Second Earth explores a voyage into the infinite, which will also teach us a great deal about our own planet and the origins of life here.", "Bounce along in the bus all over town with this favorite nursery rhyme!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/Cocomelon?sub_confirmation=1\nWEBSITE: http://www.Cocomelon.com\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/Cocomelonkids/\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/Cocomelonkids\n\nJJ, YoYo, and TomTom are happy to say ABCkidTV has a new name - it\u2019s \u201cCocomelon\u201d!

Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed.\n\nThis model, known as the nebular hypothesis was first developed in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace. Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy, physics, geology, and planetary science. Since the dawn of the space age in the 1950s and the discovery of extrasolar planets in the 1990s, the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations.\n\nThe Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation. Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets, while other moons are thought to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets. Still others, such as Earth's Moon, may be the result of giant collisions. Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System. The positions of the planets might have shifted due to gravitational interactions. This planetary migration is now thought to have been responsible for much of the Solar System's early evolution.\n\nIn roughly 5 billion years, the Sun will cool and expand outward to many times its current diameter (becoming a red giant), before casting off its outer layers as a planetary nebula and leaving behind a stellar remnant known as a white dwarf. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, others ejected into interstellar space. Ultimately, over the course of tens of billions of years, it is likely that the Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it", "Twitter : https://twitter.com/Blaz_ey_Fear_ey\nIG : https://www.instagram.com/callme_blaze/\nBadge Grinder Twitter: https://twitter.com/2kGrindBadges4U", "Foster The People's \u201cWorst Nites\u201d is available now: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites\n \nAmazon Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/az\nApple Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/applemusic\niTunes: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/itunes\nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/spotify\nYouTube Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/youtubemusic\n \nFollow Foster The People:\nhttp://fosterthepeople.com\nhttp://facebook.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://twitter.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://instagram.com/fosterthepeople\n\nDirectors \u2014 Mark Foster & Josh Hutcherson\nWritten by Josh Hutcherson & Mark Foster\nProduction Company \u2014 Burning Film (burningfilm.com)\nProducer \u2014 Ryland Burns\nCo-Producer - Josh Hutcherson\nCinematographer \u2014 Dannel Escallon\nProduction Designer \u2014 Tyler Evans\nEditor \u2014 John-Michael Powell\nColorist \u2013 Derek Hansen\nCo-Producer \u2014 Christo Arsenio\n1st AD \u2014 Rene Gannon-O\u2019Gara\nWardrobe \u2014 Debbie Gonzalez\nMakeup \u2014 Nikoleta Skarlaty\nCasting \u2014 Jonathan Buckley\nChoreographer \u2014 Chris Scott\n1st AC \u2014 Steve Doyle\n2nd AC \u2014 Ajiri Akpolo\nSteadicam \u2014 Aaron Gantt\nGaffer \u2014 Albert Gonzalez\nKey Grip \u2014 Mark Rodriguez\nGrips \u2014 Dan Martinez, Sergio Nava, & Angel Villarreal\nArt Director \u2014 Craig Smith\nPA \u2014 Eli Paul\n \nStarring \u2014 Richie The Barber, Chris Andrews, Kyle Brown, Stacey Kenealy, Gordana Simunovic, Austin Spacy, & Mark Laursen", "TROLLS (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) out now! \niTunes: http://smarturl.it/Trolls?IQid=dwyt \nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/StreamTrollsOST?IQid=dwyt\nAmazon: http://smarturl.it/TrollsAmz?IQid=dwyt\nGoogle Play: http://smarturl.it/TrollsOSTGP?IQid=dwyt \n\nPhysical copies available at Walmart: http://smarturl.it/TrollsWalmart?IQid=dwyt | Target:http://smarturl.it/TrollsTarget?IQid=dwyt | Best Buy: http://smarturl.it/TrollsBestBuy?IQid=dwyt | FYE:http://smarturl.it/TrollsFYE?IQid=dwyt\n\nFrom the creators of SHREK comes DreamWorks Animation\u2019s TROLLS, a smart, funny and irreverent comedy about the search for happiness, and just how far some will go to get it.  This hilarious film transports audiences to a colorful, wondrous world populated by the overly optimistic Trolls, who have a constant dance in their step and a song on their lips, and the comically pessimistic Bergens, who are only happy when they have trolls in their stomachs.  \n\nAfter the Bergens invade Troll Village, Poppy (Kendrick), the happiest Troll ever born, and the overly-cautious curmudgeonly Branch (Timberlake) set off on a journey to rescue her friends.  Together, this mismatched duo embarks on a rescue mission full of adventure and mishaps \u2013 trying to tolerate each other long enough to get the job done.  \n\nUtilizing music to further the film's narrative, the TROLLS soundtrack is produced by Justin Timberlake and features five original songs including songs by Justin Timberlake, Ariana Grande, Anna Kendrick and Gwen Stefani, in addition to a number of classic hits from the \u201860s through the \u201880s. \n\n\nFollow DreamWorksTV! \ninstagram - https://instagram.com/dreamworkstv/\ntwitter - https://twitter.com/dreamworkstv\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/dreamworkstv\n\nJoin the fun on DreamWorksTV where you can find an endless supply of laugh-out-loud jokes, lovable characters, life hacks, music, magic, gaming and more!

The Grinch tells the story of a cynical grump who goes on a mission to steal Christmas, only to have his heart changed by a young girl\u2019s generous holiday spirit.  Funny, heartwarming and visually stunning, it\u2019s a universal story about the spirit of Christmas and the indomitable power of optimism.\n \nAcademy Award\u00ae nominee Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to the infamous Grinch, who lives a solitary life inside a cave on Mt. Crumpet with only his loyal dog, Max, for company.  With a cave rigged with inventions and contraptions for his day-to-day needs, the Grinch only sees his neighbors in Who-ville when he runs out of food.\n \nEach year at Christmas they disrupt his tranquil solitude with their increasingly bigger, brighter and louder celebrations.  When the Whos declare they are going to make Christmas three times bigger this year, the Grinch realizes there is only one way for him to gain some peace and quiet: he must steal Christmas.  To do so, he decides he will pose as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, even going so far as to trap a lackadaisical misfit reindeer to pull his sleigh.\n \nMeanwhile, down in Who-ville, Cindy-Lou Who\u2014a young girl overflowing with holiday cheer\u2014plots with her gang of friends to trap Santa Claus as he makes his Christmas Eve rounds so that she can thank him for help for her overworked single mother.  As Christmas approaches, however, her good-natured scheme threatens to collide with the Grinch\u2019s more nefarious one.  Will Cindy-Lou achieve her goal of finally meeting Santa Claus?  Will the Grinch succeed in silencing the Whos\u2019 holiday cheer once and for all?\n \nFind out, Christmas season 2018.", "Moonshine Jungle Tour 2014 tickets and more info: \nhttp://www.brunomars.com/moonshinejungletour\n\nAvailable now on iTunes! http://smarturl.it/Doo-Wops\n\n\u00a9 2011 WMG.

And it takes us beyond the stars to the far reaches of the universe in search of life somewhere other than Earth.\n\nTo date, astronomers have detected over 3000 planets located outside the solar system. When one thinks that twenty years ago, the only planets we could observe were those in our own solar system, this is both a revolution and a revelation.\n\nWith the construction of giant telescopes, thousands or even millions of other worlds will soon be discovered. These so-called exoplanets are all very different. But could any of them support life? The most recent research shows that life is much more tenacious and resilient than we once thought.\n\nAre we alone in the universe? This question, which for so long was chiefly a religious and philosophical one, has now become rational and scientific. If other inhabited planets exist, how can we detect them? How can we discover what flora, fauna or even what kind of strange civilisations they may host?

Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed.\n\nThis model, known as the nebular hypothesis was first developed in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace. Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy, physics, geology, and planetary science. Since the dawn of the space age in the 1950s and the discovery of extrasolar planets in the 1990s, the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations.\n\nThe Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation. Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets, while other moons are thought to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets. Still others, such as Earth's Moon, may be the result of giant collisions. Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System. The positions of the planets might have shifted due to gravitational interactions. This planetary migration is now thought to have been responsible for much of the Solar System's early evolution.\n\nIn roughly 5 billion years, the Sun will cool and expand outward to many times its current diameter (becoming a red giant), before casting off its outer layers as a planetary nebula and leaving behind a stellar remnant known as a white dwarf. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, others ejected into interstellar space. Ultimately, over the course of tens of billions of years, it is likely that the Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it", "Twitter : https://twitter.com/Blaz_ey_Fear_ey\nIG : https://www.instagram.com/callme_blaze/\nBadge Grinder Twitter: https://twitter.com/2kGrindBadges4U", "Foster The People's \u201cWorst Nites\u201d is available now: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites\n \nAmazon Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/az\nApple Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/applemusic\niTunes: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/itunes\nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/spotify\nYouTube Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/youtubemusic\n \nFollow Foster The People:\nhttp://fosterthepeople.com\nhttp://facebook.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://twitter.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://instagram.com/fosterthepeople\n\nDirectors \u2014 Mark Foster & Josh Hutcherson\nWritten by Josh Hutcherson & Mark Foster\nProduction Company \u2014 Burning Film (burningfilm.com)\nProducer \u2014 Ryland Burns\nCo-Producer - Josh Hutcherson\nCinematographer \u2014 Dannel Escallon\nProduction Designer \u2014 Tyler Evans\nEditor \u2014 John-Michael Powell\nColorist \u2013 Derek Hansen\nCo-Producer \u2014 Christo Arsenio\n1st AD \u2014 Rene Gannon-O\u2019Gara\nWardrobe \u2014 Debbie Gonzalez\nMakeup \u2014 Nikoleta Skarlaty\nCasting \u2014 Jonathan Buckley\nChoreographer \u2014 Chris Scott\n1st AC \u2014 Steve Doyle\n2nd AC \u2014 Ajiri Akpolo\nSteadicam \u2014 Aaron Gantt\nGaffer \u2014 Albert Gonzalez\nKey Grip \u2014 Mark Rodriguez\nGrips \u2014 Dan Martinez, Sergio Nava, & Angel Villarreal\nArt Director \u2014 Craig Smith\nPA \u2014 Eli Paul\n \nStarring \u2014 Richie The Barber, Chris Andrews, Kyle Brown, Stacey Kenealy, Gordana Simunovic, Austin Spacy, & Mark Laursen", "TROLLS (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) out now! \niTunes: http://smarturl.it/Trolls?IQid=dwyt \nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/StreamTrollsOST?IQid=dwyt\nAmazon: http://smarturl.it/TrollsAmz?IQid=dwyt\nGoogle Play: http://smarturl.it/TrollsOSTGP?IQid=dwyt \n\nPhysical copies available at Walmart: http://smarturl.it/TrollsWalmart?IQid=dwyt | Target:http://smarturl.it/TrollsTarget?IQid=dwyt | Best Buy: http://smarturl.it/TrollsBestBuy?IQid=dwyt | FYE:http://smarturl.it/TrollsFYE?IQid=dwyt\n\nFrom the creators of SHREK comes DreamWorks Animation\u2019s TROLLS, a smart, funny and irreverent comedy about the search for happiness, and just how far some will go to get it.  This hilarious film transports audiences to a colorful, wondrous world populated by the overly optimistic Trolls, who have a constant dance in their step and a song on their lips, and the comically pessimistic Bergens, who are only happy when they have trolls in their stomachs.  \n\nAfter the Bergens invade Troll Village, Poppy (Kendrick), the happiest Troll ever born, and the overly-cautious curmudgeonly Branch (Timberlake) set off on a journey to rescue her friends.  Together, this mismatched duo embarks on a rescue mission full of adventure and mishaps \u2013 trying to tolerate each other long enough to get the job done.  \n\nUtilizing music to further the film's narrative, the TROLLS soundtrack is produced by Justin Timberlake and features five original songs including songs by Justin Timberlake, Ariana Grande, Anna Kendrick and Gwen Stefani, in addition to a number of classic hits from the \u201860s through the \u201880s. \n\n\nFollow DreamWorksTV! \ninstagram - https://instagram.com/dreamworkstv/\ntwitter - https://twitter.com/dreamworkstv\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/dreamworkstv\n\nJoin the fun on DreamWorksTV where you can find an endless supply of laugh-out-loud jokes, lovable characters, life hacks, music, magic, gaming and more!

The Grinch tells the story of a cynical grump who goes on a mission to steal Christmas, only to have his heart changed by a young girl\u2019s generous holiday spirit.  Funny, heartwarming and visually stunning, it\u2019s a universal story about the spirit of Christmas and the indomitable power of optimism.\n \nAcademy Award\u00ae nominee Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to the infamous Grinch, who lives a solitary life inside a cave on Mt. Crumpet with only his loyal dog, Max, for company.  With a cave rigged with inventions and contraptions for his day-to-day needs, the Grinch only sees his neighbors in Who-ville when he runs out of food.\n \nEach year at Christmas they disrupt his tranquil solitude with their increasingly bigger, brighter and louder celebrations.  When the Whos declare they are going to make Christmas three times bigger this year, the Grinch realizes there is only one way for him to gain some peace and quiet: he must steal Christmas.  To do so, he decides he will pose as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, even going so far as to trap a lackadaisical misfit reindeer to pull his sleigh.\n \nMeanwhile, down in Who-ville, Cindy-Lou Who\u2014a young girl overflowing with holiday cheer\u2014plots with her gang of friends to trap Santa Claus as he makes his Christmas Eve rounds so that she can thank him for help for her overworked single mother.  As Christmas approaches, however, her good-natured scheme threatens to collide with the Grinch\u2019s more nefarious one.  Will Cindy-Lou achieve her goal of finally meeting Santa Claus?  Will the Grinch succeed in silencing the Whos\u2019 holiday cheer once and for all?\n \nFind out, Christmas season 2018.", "Moonshine Jungle Tour 2014 tickets and more info: \nhttp://www.brunomars.com/moonshinejungletour\n\nAvailable now on iTunes! http://smarturl.it/Doo-Wops\n\n\u00a9 2011 WMG.

And it takes us beyond the stars to the far reaches of the universe in search of life somewhere other than Earth.\n\nTo date, astronomers have detected over 3000 planets located outside the solar system. When one thinks that twenty years ago, the only planets we could observe were those in our own solar system, this is both a revolution and a revelation.\n\nWith the construction of giant telescopes, thousands or even millions of other worlds will soon be discovered. These so-called exoplanets are all very different. But could any of them support life? The most recent research shows that life is much more tenacious and resilient than we once thought.\n\nAre we alone in the universe? This question, which for so long was chiefly a religious and philosophical one, has now become rational and scientific. If other inhabited planets exist, how can we detect them? How can we discover what flora, fauna or even what kind of strange civilisations they may host?

Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed.\n\nThis model, known as the nebular hypothesis was first developed in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace. Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy, physics, geology, and planetary science. Since the dawn of the space age in the 1950s and the discovery of extrasolar planets in the 1990s, the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations.\n\nThe Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation. Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets, while other moons are thought to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets. Still others, such as Earth's Moon, may be the result of giant collisions. Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System. The positions of the planets might have shifted due to gravitational interactions. This planetary migration is now thought to have been responsible for much of the Solar System's early evolution.\n\nIn roughly 5 billion years, the Sun will cool and expand outward to many times its current diameter (becoming a red giant), before casting off its outer layers as a planetary nebula and leaving behind a stellar remnant known as a white dwarf. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, others ejected into interstellar space. Ultimately, over the course of tens of billions of years, it is likely that the Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it", "Twitter : https://twitter.com/Blaz_ey_Fear_ey\nIG : https://www.instagram.com/callme_blaze/\nBadge Grinder Twitter: https://twitter.com/2kGrindBadges4U", "Foster The People's \u201cWorst Nites\u201d is available now: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites\n \nAmazon Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/az\nApple Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/applemusic\niTunes: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/itunes\nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/spotify\nYouTube Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/youtubemusic\n \nFollow Foster The People:\nhttp://fosterthepeople.com\nhttp://facebook.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://twitter.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://instagram.com/fosterthepeople\n\nDirectors \u2014 Mark Foster & Josh Hutcherson\nWritten by Josh Hutcherson & Mark Foster\nProduction Company \u2014 Burning Film (burningfilm.com)\nProducer \u2014 Ryland Burns\nCo-Producer - Josh Hutcherson\nCinematographer \u2014 Dannel Escallon\nProduction Designer \u2014 Tyler Evans\nEditor \u2014 John-Michael Powell\nColorist \u2013 Derek Hansen\nCo-Producer \u2014 Christo Arsenio\n1st AD \u2014 Rene Gannon-O\u2019Gara\nWardrobe \u2014 Debbie Gonzalez\nMakeup \u2014 Nikoleta Skarlaty\nCasting \u2014 Jonathan Buckley\nChoreographer \u2014 Chris Scott\n1st AC \u2014 Steve Doyle\n2nd AC \u2014 Ajiri Akpolo\nSteadicam \u2014 Aaron Gantt\nGaffer \u2014 Albert Gonzalez\nKey Grip \u2014 Mark Rodriguez\nGrips \u2014 Dan Martinez, Sergio Nava, & Angel Villarreal\nArt Director \u2014 Craig Smith\nPA \u2014 Eli Paul\n \nStarring \u2014 Richie The Barber, Chris Andrews, Kyle Brown, Stacey Kenealy, Gordana Simunovic, Austin Spacy, & Mark Laursen", "TROLLS (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) out now! \niTunes: http://smarturl.it/Trolls?IQid=dwyt \nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/StreamTrollsOST?IQid=dwyt\nAmazon: http://smarturl.it/TrollsAmz?IQid=dwyt\nGoogle Play: http://smarturl.it/TrollsOSTGP?IQid=dwyt \n\nPhysical copies available at Walmart: http://smarturl.it/TrollsWalmart?IQid=dwyt | Target:http://smarturl.it/TrollsTarget?IQid=dwyt | Best Buy: http://smarturl.it/TrollsBestBuy?IQid=dwyt | FYE:http://smarturl.it/TrollsFYE?IQid=dwyt\n\nFrom the creators of SHREK comes DreamWorks Animation\u2019s TROLLS, a smart, funny and irreverent comedy about the search for happiness, and just how far some will go to get it.  This hilarious film transports audiences to a colorful, wondrous world populated by the overly optimistic Trolls, who have a constant dance in their step and a song on their lips, and the comically pessimistic Bergens, who are only happy when they have trolls in their stomachs.  \n\nAfter the Bergens invade Troll Village, Poppy (Kendrick), the happiest Troll ever born, and the overly-cautious curmudgeonly Branch (Timberlake) set off on a journey to rescue her friends.  Together, this mismatched duo embarks on a rescue mission full of adventure and mishaps \u2013 trying to tolerate each other long enough to get the job done.  \n\nUtilizing music to further the film's narrative, the TROLLS soundtrack is produced by Justin Timberlake and features five original songs including songs by Justin Timberlake, Ariana Grande, Anna Kendrick and Gwen Stefani, in addition to a number of classic hits from the \u201860s through the \u201880s. \n\n\nFollow DreamWorksTV! \ninstagram - https://instagram.com/dreamworkstv/\ntwitter - https://twitter.com/dreamworkstv\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/dreamworkstv\n\nJoin the fun on DreamWorksTV where you can find an endless supply of laugh-out-loud jokes, lovable characters, life hacks, music, magic, gaming and more!

The Grinch tells the story of a cynical grump who goes on a mission to steal Christmas, only to have his heart changed by a young girl\u2019s generous holiday spirit.  Funny, heartwarming and visually stunning, it\u2019s a universal story about the spirit of Christmas and the indomitable power of optimism.\n \nAcademy Award\u00ae nominee Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to the infamous Grinch, who lives a solitary life inside a cave on Mt. Crumpet with only his loyal dog, Max, for company.  With a cave rigged with inventions and contraptions for his day-to-day needs, the Grinch only sees his neighbors in Who-ville when he runs out of food.\n \nEach year at Christmas they disrupt his tranquil solitude with their increasingly bigger, brighter and louder celebrations.  When the Whos declare they are going to make Christmas three times bigger this year, the Grinch realizes there is only one way for him to gain some peace and quiet: he must steal Christmas.  To do so, he decides he will pose as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, even going so far as to trap a lackadaisical misfit reindeer to pull his sleigh.\n \nMeanwhile, down in Who-ville, Cindy-Lou Who\u2014a young girl overflowing with holiday cheer\u2014plots with her gang of friends to trap Santa Claus as he makes his Christmas Eve rounds so that she can thank him for help for her overworked single mother.  As Christmas approaches, however, her good-natured scheme threatens to collide with the Grinch\u2019s more nefarious one.  Will Cindy-Lou achieve her goal of finally meeting Santa Claus?  Will the Grinch succeed in silencing the Whos\u2019 holiday cheer once and for all?\n \nFind out, Christmas season 2018.", "Moonshine Jungle Tour 2014 tickets and more info: \nhttp://www.brunomars.com/moonshinejungletour\n\nAvailable now on iTunes! http://smarturl.it/Doo-Wops\n\n\u00a9 2011 WMG.

And it takes us beyond the stars to the far reaches of the universe in search of life somewhere other than Earth.\n\nTo date, astronomers have detected over 3000 planets located outside the solar system. When one thinks that twenty years ago, the only planets we could observe were those in our own solar system, this is both a revolution and a revelation.\n\nWith the construction of giant telescopes, thousands or even millions of other worlds will soon be discovered. These so-called exoplanets are all very different. But could any of them support life? The most recent research shows that life is much more tenacious and resilient than we once thought.\n\nAre we alone in the universe? This question, which for so long was chiefly a religious and philosophical one, has now become rational and scientific. If other inhabited planets exist, how can we detect them? How can we discover what flora, fauna or even what kind of strange civilisations they may host?

Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed.\n\nThis model, known as the nebular hypothesis was first developed in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace. Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy, physics, geology, and planetary science. Since the dawn of the space age in the 1950s and the discovery of extrasolar planets in the 1990s, the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations.\n\nThe Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation. Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets, while other moons are thought to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets. Still others, such as Earth's Moon, may be the result of giant collisions. Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System. The positions of the planets might have shifted due to gravitational interactions. This planetary migration is now thought to have been responsible for much of the Solar System's early evolution.\n\nIn roughly 5 billion years, the Sun will cool and expand outward to many times its current diameter (becoming a red giant), before casting off its outer layers as a planetary nebula and leaving behind a stellar remnant known as a white dwarf. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, others ejected into interstellar space. Ultimately, over the course of tens of billions of years, it is likely that the Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it", "Twitter : https://twitter.com/Blaz_ey_Fear_ey\nIG : https://www.instagram.com/callme_blaze/\nBadge Grinder Twitter: https://twitter.com/2kGrindBadges4U", "Foster The People's \u201cWorst Nites\u201d is available now: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites\n \nAmazon Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/az\nApple Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/applemusic\niTunes: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/itunes\nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/spotify\nYouTube Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/youtubemusic\n \nFollow Foster The People:\nhttp://fosterthepeople.com\nhttp://facebook.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://twitter.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://instagram.com/fosterthepeople\n\nDirectors \u2014 Mark Foster & Josh Hutcherson\nWritten by Josh Hutcherson & Mark Foster\nProduction Company \u2014 Burning Film (burningfilm.com)\nProducer \u2014 Ryland Burns\nCo-Producer - Josh Hutcherson\nCinematographer \u2014 Dannel Escallon\nProduction Designer \u2014 Tyler Evans\nEditor \u2014 John-Michael Powell\nColorist \u2013 Derek Hansen\nCo-Producer \u2014 Christo Arsenio\n1st AD \u2014 Rene Gannon-O\u2019Gara\nWardrobe \u2014 Debbie Gonzalez\nMakeup \u2014 Nikoleta Skarlaty\nCasting \u2014 Jonathan Buckley\nChoreographer \u2014 Chris Scott\n1st AC \u2014 Steve Doyle\n2nd AC \u2014 Ajiri Akpolo\nSteadicam \u2014 Aaron Gantt\nGaffer \u2014 Albert Gonzalez\nKey Grip \u2014 Mark Rodriguez\nGrips \u2014 Dan Martinez, Sergio Nava, & Angel Villarreal\nArt Director \u2014 Craig Smith\nPA \u2014 Eli Paul\n \nStarring \u2014 Richie The Barber, Chris Andrews, Kyle Brown, Stacey Kenealy, Gordana Simunovic, Austin Spacy, & Mark Laursen", "TROLLS (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) out now! \niTunes: http://smarturl.it/Trolls?IQid=dwyt \nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/StreamTrollsOST?IQid=dwyt\nAmazon: http://smarturl.it/TrollsAmz?IQid=dwyt\nGoogle Play: http://smarturl.it/TrollsOSTGP?IQid=dwyt \n\nPhysical copies available at Walmart: http://smarturl.it/TrollsWalmart?IQid=dwyt | Target:http://smarturl.it/TrollsTarget?IQid=dwyt | Best Buy: http://smarturl.it/TrollsBestBuy?IQid=dwyt | FYE:http://smarturl.it/TrollsFYE?IQid=dwyt\n\nFrom the creators of SHREK comes DreamWorks Animation\u2019s TROLLS, a smart, funny and irreverent comedy about the search for happiness, and just how far some will go to get it.  This hilarious film transports audiences to a colorful, wondrous world populated by the overly optimistic Trolls, who have a constant dance in their step and a song on their lips, and the comically pessimistic Bergens, who are only happy when they have trolls in their stomachs.  \n\nAfter the Bergens invade Troll Village, Poppy (Kendrick), the happiest Troll ever born, and the overly-cautious curmudgeonly Branch (Timberlake) set off on a journey to rescue her friends.  Together, this mismatched duo embarks on a rescue mission full of adventure and mishaps \u2013 trying to tolerate each other long enough to get the job done.  \n\nUtilizing music to further the film's narrative, the TROLLS soundtrack is produced by Justin Timberlake and features five original songs including songs by Justin Timberlake, Ariana Grande, Anna Kendrick and Gwen Stefani, in addition to a number of classic hits from the \u201860s through the \u201880s. \n\n\nFollow DreamWorksTV! \ninstagram - https://instagram.com/dreamworkstv/\ntwitter - https://twitter.com/dreamworkstv\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/dreamworkstv\n\nJoin the fun on DreamWorksTV where you can find an endless supply of laugh-out-loud jokes, lovable characters, life hacks, music, magic, gaming and more!

The Grinch tells the story of a cynical grump who goes on a mission to steal Christmas, only to have his heart changed by a young girl\u2019s generous holiday spirit.  Funny, heartwarming and visually stunning, it\u2019s a universal story about the spirit of Christmas and the indomitable power of optimism.\n \nAcademy Award\u00ae nominee Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to the infamous Grinch, who lives a solitary life inside a cave on Mt. Crumpet with only his loyal dog, Max, for company.  With a cave rigged with inventions and contraptions for his day-to-day needs, the Grinch only sees his neighbors in Who-ville when he runs out of food.\n \nEach year at Christmas they disrupt his tranquil solitude with their increasingly bigger, brighter and louder celebrations.  When the Whos declare they are going to make Christmas three times bigger this year, the Grinch realizes there is only one way for him to gain some peace and quiet: he must steal Christmas.  To do so, he decides he will pose as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, even going so far as to trap a lackadaisical misfit reindeer to pull his sleigh.\n \nMeanwhile, down in Who-ville, Cindy-Lou Who\u2014a young girl overflowing with holiday cheer\u2014plots with her gang of friends to trap Santa Claus as he makes his Christmas Eve rounds so that she can thank him for help for her overworked single mother.  As Christmas approaches, however, her good-natured scheme threatens to collide with the Grinch\u2019s more nefarious one.  Will Cindy-Lou achieve her goal of finally meeting Santa Claus?  Will the Grinch succeed in silencing the Whos\u2019 holiday cheer once and for all?\n \nFind out, Christmas season 2018.", "Moonshine Jungle Tour 2014 tickets and more info: \nhttp://www.brunomars.com/moonshinejungletour\n\nAvailable now on iTunes! http://smarturl.it/Doo-Wops\n\n\u00a9 2011 WMG.

And it takes us beyond the stars to the far reaches of the universe in search of life somewhere other than Earth.\n\nTo date, astronomers have detected over 3000 planets located outside the solar system. When one thinks that twenty years ago, the only planets we could observe were those in our own solar system, this is both a revolution and a revelation.\n\nWith the construction of giant telescopes, thousands or even millions of other worlds will soon be discovered. These so-called exoplanets are all very different. But could any of them support life? The most recent research shows that life is much more tenacious and resilient than we once thought.\n\nAre we alone in the universe? This question, which for so long was chiefly a religious and philosophical one, has now become rational and scientific. If other inhabited planets exist, how can we detect them? How can we discover what flora, fauna or even what kind of strange civilisations they may host?

Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed.\n\nThis model, known as the nebular hypothesis was first developed in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace. Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy, physics, geology, and planetary science. Since the dawn of the space age in the 1950s and the discovery of extrasolar planets in the 1990s, the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations.\n\nThe Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation. Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets, while other moons are thought to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets. Still others, such as Earth's Moon, may be the result of giant collisions. Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System. The positions of the planets might have shifted due to gravitational interactions. This planetary migration is now thought to have been responsible for much of the Solar System's early evolution.\n\nIn roughly 5 billion years, the Sun will cool and expand outward to many times its current diameter (becoming a red giant), before casting off its outer layers as a planetary nebula and leaving behind a stellar remnant known as a white dwarf. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, others ejected into interstellar space. Ultimately, over the course of tens of billions of years, it is likely that the Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it", "Twitter : https://twitter.com/Blaz_ey_Fear_ey\nIG : https://www.instagram.com/callme_blaze/\nBadge Grinder Twitter: https://twitter.com/2kGrindBadges4U", "Foster The People's \u201cWorst Nites\u201d is available now: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites\n \nAmazon Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/az\nApple Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/applemusic\niTunes: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/itunes\nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/spotify\nYouTube Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/youtubemusic\n \nFollow Foster The People:\nhttp://fosterthepeople.com\nhttp://facebook.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://twitter.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://instagram.com/fosterthepeople\n\nDirectors \u2014 Mark Foster & Josh Hutcherson\nWritten by Josh Hutcherson & Mark Foster\nProduction Company \u2014 Burning Film (burningfilm.com)\nProducer \u2014 Ryland Burns\nCo-Producer - Josh Hutcherson\nCinematographer \u2014 Dannel Escallon\nProduction Designer \u2014 Tyler Evans\nEditor \u2014 John-Michael Powell\nColorist \u2013 Derek Hansen\nCo-Producer \u2014 Christo Arsenio\n1st AD \u2014 Rene Gannon-O\u2019Gara\nWardrobe \u2014 Debbie Gonzalez\nMakeup \u2014 Nikoleta Skarlaty\nCasting \u2014 Jonathan Buckley\nChoreographer \u2014 Chris Scott\n1st AC \u2014 Steve Doyle\n2nd AC \u2014 Ajiri Akpolo\nSteadicam \u2014 Aaron Gantt\nGaffer \u2014 Albert Gonzalez\nKey Grip \u2014 Mark Rodriguez\nGrips \u2014 Dan Martinez, Sergio Nava, & Angel Villarreal\nArt Director \u2014 Craig Smith\nPA \u2014 Eli Paul\n \nStarring \u2014 Richie The Barber, Chris Andrews, Kyle Brown, Stacey Kenealy, Gordana Simunovic, Austin Spacy, & Mark Laursen", "TROLLS (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) out now! \niTunes: http://smarturl.it/Trolls?IQid=dwyt \nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/StreamTrollsOST?IQid=dwyt\nAmazon: http://smarturl.it/TrollsAmz?IQid=dwyt\nGoogle Play: http://smarturl.it/TrollsOSTGP?IQid=dwyt \n\nPhysical copies available at Walmart: http://smarturl.it/TrollsWalmart?IQid=dwyt | Target:http://smarturl.it/TrollsTarget?IQid=dwyt | Best Buy: http://smarturl.it/TrollsBestBuy?IQid=dwyt | FYE:http://smarturl.it/TrollsFYE?IQid=dwyt\n\nFrom the creators of SHREK comes DreamWorks Animation\u2019s TROLLS, a smart, funny and irreverent comedy about the search for happiness, and just how far some will go to get it.  This hilarious film transports audiences to a colorful, wondrous world populated by the overly optimistic Trolls, who have a constant dance in their step and a song on their lips, and the comically pessimistic Bergens, who are only happy when they have trolls in their stomachs.  \n\nAfter the Bergens invade Troll Village, Poppy (Kendrick), the happiest Troll ever born, and the overly-cautious curmudgeonly Branch (Timberlake) set off on a journey to rescue her friends.  Together, this mismatched duo embarks on a rescue mission full of adventure and mishaps \u2013 trying to tolerate each other long enough to get the job done.  \n\nUtilizing music to further the film's narrative, the TROLLS soundtrack is produced by Justin Timberlake and features five original songs including songs by Justin Timberlake, Ariana Grande, Anna Kendrick and Gwen Stefani, in addition to a number of classic hits from the \u201860s through the \u201880s. \n\n\nFollow DreamWorksTV! \ninstagram - https://instagram.com/dreamworkstv/\ntwitter - https://twitter.com/dreamworkstv\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/dreamworkstv\n\nJoin the fun on DreamWorksTV where you can find an endless supply of laugh-out-loud jokes, lovable characters, life hacks, music, magic, gaming and more!

The Grinch tells the story of a cynical grump who goes on a mission to steal Christmas, only to have his heart changed by a young girl\u2019s generous holiday spirit.  Funny, heartwarming and visually stunning, it\u2019s a universal story about the spirit of Christmas and the indomitable power of optimism.\n \nAcademy Award\u00ae nominee Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to the infamous Grinch, who lives a solitary life inside a cave on Mt. Crumpet with only his loyal dog, Max, for company.  With a cave rigged with inventions and contraptions for his day-to-day needs, the Grinch only sees his neighbors in Who-ville when he runs out of food.\n \nEach year at Christmas they disrupt his tranquil solitude with their increasingly bigger, brighter and louder celebrations.  When the Whos declare they are going to make Christmas three times bigger this year, the Grinch realizes there is only one way for him to gain some peace and quiet: he must steal Christmas.  To do so, he decides he will pose as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, even going so far as to trap a lackadaisical misfit reindeer to pull his sleigh.\n \nMeanwhile, down in Who-ville, Cindy-Lou Who\u2014a young girl overflowing with holiday cheer\u2014plots with her gang of friends to trap Santa Claus as he makes his Christmas Eve rounds so that she can thank him for help for her overworked single mother.  As Christmas approaches, however, her good-natured scheme threatens to collide with the Grinch\u2019s more nefarious one.  Will Cindy-Lou achieve her goal of finally meeting Santa Claus?  Will the Grinch succeed in silencing the Whos\u2019 holiday cheer once and for all?\n \nFind out, Christmas season 2018.", "Moonshine Jungle Tour 2014 tickets and more info: \nhttp://www.brunomars.com/moonshinejungletour\n\nAvailable now on iTunes! http://smarturl.it/Doo-Wops\n\n\u00a9 2011 WMG.

And it takes us beyond the stars to the far reaches of the universe in search of life somewhere other than Earth.\n\nTo date, astronomers have detected over 3000 planets located outside the solar system. When one thinks that twenty years ago, the only planets we could observe were those in our own solar system, this is both a revolution and a revelation.\n\nWith the construction of giant telescopes, thousands or even millions of other worlds will soon be discovered. These so-called exoplanets are all very different. But could any of them support life? The most recent research shows that life is much more tenacious and resilient than we once thought.\n\nAre we alone in the universe? This question, which for so long was chiefly a religious and philosophical one, has now become rational and scientific. If other inhabited planets exist, how can we detect them? How can we discover what flora, fauna or even what kind of strange civilisations they may host?

Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed.\n\nThis model, known as the nebular hypothesis was first developed in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace. Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy, physics, geology, and planetary science. Since the dawn of the space age in the 1950s and the discovery of extrasolar planets in the 1990s, the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations.\n\nThe Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation. Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets, while other moons are thought to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets. Still others, such as Earth's Moon, may be the result of giant collisions. Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System. The positions of the planets might have shifted due to gravitational interactions. This planetary migration is now thought to have been responsible for much of the Solar System's early evolution.\n\nIn roughly 5 billion years, the Sun will cool and expand outward to many times its current diameter (becoming a red giant), before casting off its outer layers as a planetary nebula and leaving behind a stellar remnant known as a white dwarf. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, others ejected into interstellar space. Ultimately, over the course of tens of billions of years, it is likely that the Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it", "Twitter : https://twitter.com/Blaz_ey_Fear_ey\nIG : https://www.instagram.com/callme_blaze/\nBadge Grinder Twitter: https://twitter.com/2kGrindBadges4U", "Foster The People's \u201cWorst Nites\u201d is available now: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites\n \nAmazon Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/az\nApple Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/applemusic\niTunes: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/itunes\nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/spotify\nYouTube Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/youtubemusic\n \nFollow Foster The People:\nhttp://fosterthepeople.com\nhttp://facebook.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://twitter.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://instagram.com/fosterthepeople\n\nDirectors \u2014 Mark Foster & Josh Hutcherson\nWritten by Josh Hutcherson & Mark Foster\nProduction Company \u2014 Burning Film (burningfilm.com)\nProducer \u2014 Ryland Burns\nCo-Producer - Josh Hutcherson\nCinematographer \u2014 Dannel Escallon\nProduction Designer \u2014 Tyler Evans\nEditor \u2014 John-Michael Powell\nColorist \u2013 Derek Hansen\nCo-Producer \u2014 Christo Arsenio\n1st AD \u2014 Rene Gannon-O\u2019Gara\nWardrobe \u2014 Debbie Gonzalez\nMakeup \u2014 Nikoleta Skarlaty\nCasting \u2014 Jonathan Buckley\nChoreographer \u2014 Chris Scott\n1st AC \u2014 Steve Doyle\n2nd AC \u2014 Ajiri Akpolo\nSteadicam \u2014 Aaron Gantt\nGaffer \u2014 Albert Gonzalez\nKey Grip \u2014 Mark Rodriguez\nGrips \u2014 Dan Martinez, Sergio Nava, & Angel Villarreal\nArt Director \u2014 Craig Smith\nPA \u2014 Eli Paul\n \nStarring \u2014 Richie The Barber, Chris Andrews, Kyle Brown, Stacey Kenealy, Gordana Simunovic, Austin Spacy, & Mark Laursen", "TROLLS (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) out now! \niTunes: http://smarturl.it/Trolls?IQid=dwyt \nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/StreamTrollsOST?IQid=dwyt\nAmazon: http://smarturl.it/TrollsAmz?IQid=dwyt\nGoogle Play: http://smarturl.it/TrollsOSTGP?IQid=dwyt \n\nPhysical copies available at Walmart: http://smarturl.it/TrollsWalmart?IQid=dwyt | Target:http://smarturl.it/TrollsTarget?IQid=dwyt | Best Buy: http://smarturl.it/TrollsBestBuy?IQid=dwyt | FYE:http://smarturl.it/TrollsFYE?IQid=dwyt\n\nFrom the creators of SHREK comes DreamWorks Animation\u2019s TROLLS, a smart, funny and irreverent comedy about the search for happiness, and just how far some will go to get it.  This hilarious film transports audiences to a colorful, wondrous world populated by the overly optimistic Trolls, who have a constant dance in their step and a song on their lips, and the comically pessimistic Bergens, who are only happy when they have trolls in their stomachs.  \n\nAfter the Bergens invade Troll Village, Poppy (Kendrick), the happiest Troll ever born, and the overly-cautious curmudgeonly Branch (Timberlake) set off on a journey to rescue her friends.  Together, this mismatched duo embarks on a rescue mission full of adventure and mishaps \u2013 trying to tolerate each other long enough to get the job done.  \n\nUtilizing music to further the film's narrative, the TROLLS soundtrack is produced by Justin Timberlake and features five original songs including songs by Justin Timberlake, Ariana Grande, Anna Kendrick and Gwen Stefani, in addition to a number of classic hits from the \u201860s through the \u201880s. \n\n\nFollow DreamWorksTV! \ninstagram - https://instagram.com/dreamworkstv/\ntwitter - https://twitter.com/dreamworkstv\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/dreamworkstv\n\nJoin the fun on DreamWorksTV where you can find an endless supply of laugh-out-loud jokes, lovable characters, life hacks, music, magic, gaming and more!

The Grinch tells the story of a cynical grump who goes on a mission to steal Christmas, only to have his heart changed by a young girl\u2019s generous holiday spirit.  Funny, heartwarming and visually stunning, it\u2019s a universal story about the spirit of Christmas and the indomitable power of optimism.\n \nAcademy Award\u00ae nominee Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to the infamous Grinch, who lives a solitary life inside a cave on Mt. Crumpet with only his loyal dog, Max, for company.  With a cave rigged with inventions and contraptions for his day-to-day needs, the Grinch only sees his neighbors in Who-ville when he runs out of food.\n \nEach year at Christmas they disrupt his tranquil solitude with their increasingly bigger, brighter and louder celebrations.  When the Whos declare they are going to make Christmas three times bigger this year, the Grinch realizes there is only one way for him to gain some peace and quiet: he must steal Christmas.  To do so, he decides he will pose as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, even going so far as to trap a lackadaisical misfit reindeer to pull his sleigh.\n \nMeanwhile, down in Who-ville, Cindy-Lou Who\u2014a young girl overflowing with holiday cheer\u2014plots with her gang of friends to trap Santa Claus as he makes his Christmas Eve rounds so that she can thank him for help for her overworked single mother.  As Christmas approaches, however, her good-natured scheme threatens to collide with the Grinch\u2019s more nefarious one.  Will Cindy-Lou achieve her goal of finally meeting Santa Claus?  Will the Grinch succeed in silencing the Whos\u2019 holiday cheer once and for all?\n \nFind out, Christmas season 2018.", "Moonshine Jungle Tour 2014 tickets and more info: \nhttp://www.brunomars.com/moonshinejungletour\n\nAvailable now on iTunes! http://smarturl.it/Doo-Wops\n\n\u00a9 2011 WMG.

And it takes us beyond the stars to the far reaches of the universe in search of life somewhere other than Earth.\n\nTo date, astronomers have detected over 3000 planets located outside the solar system. When one thinks that twenty years ago, the only planets we could observe were those in our own solar system, this is both a revolution and a revelation.\n\nWith the construction of giant telescopes, thousands or even millions of other worlds will soon be discovered. These so-called exoplanets are all very different. But could any of them support life? The most recent research shows that life is much more tenacious and resilient than we once thought.\n\nAre we alone in the universe? This question, which for so long was chiefly a religious and philosophical one, has now become rational and scientific. If other inhabited planets exist, how can we detect them? How can we discover what flora, fauna or even what kind of strange civilisations they may host?

Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed.\n\nThis model, known as the nebular hypothesis was first developed in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace. Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy, physics, geology, and planetary science. Since the dawn of the space age in the 1950s and the discovery of extrasolar planets in the 1990s, the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations.\n\nThe Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation. Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets, while other moons are thought to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets. Still others, such as Earth's Moon, may be the result of giant collisions. Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System. The positions of the planets might have shifted due to gravitational interactions. This planetary migration is now thought to have been responsible for much of the Solar System's early evolution.\n\nIn roughly 5 billion years, the Sun will cool and expand outward to many times its current diameter (becoming a red giant), before casting off its outer layers as a planetary nebula and leaving behind a stellar remnant known as a white dwarf. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, others ejected into interstellar space. Ultimately, over the course of tens of billions of years, it is likely that the Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it", "Twitter : https://twitter.com/Blaz_ey_Fear_ey\nIG : https://www.instagram.com/callme_blaze/\nBadge Grinder Twitter: https://twitter.com/2kGrindBadges4U", "Foster The People's \u201cWorst Nites\u201d is available now: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites\n \nAmazon Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/az\nApple Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/applemusic\niTunes: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/itunes\nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/spotify\nYouTube Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/youtubemusic\n \nFollow Foster The People:\nhttp://fosterthepeople.com\nhttp://facebook.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://twitter.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://instagram.com/fosterthepeople\n\nDirectors \u2014 Mark Foster & Josh Hutcherson\nWritten by Josh Hutcherson & Mark Foster\nProduction Company \u2014 Burning Film (burningfilm.com)\nProducer \u2014 Ryland Burns\nCo-Producer - Josh Hutcherson\nCinematographer \u2014 Dannel Escallon\nProduction Designer \u2014 Tyler Evans\nEditor \u2014 John-Michael Powell\nColorist \u2013 Derek Hansen\nCo-Producer \u2014 Christo Arsenio\n1st AD \u2014 Rene Gannon-O\u2019Gara\nWardrobe \u2014 Debbie Gonzalez\nMakeup \u2014 Nikoleta Skarlaty\nCasting \u2014 Jonathan Buckley\nChoreographer \u2014 Chris Scott\n1st AC \u2014 Steve Doyle\n2nd AC \u2014 Ajiri Akpolo\nSteadicam \u2014 Aaron Gantt\nGaffer \u2014 Albert Gonzalez\nKey Grip \u2014 Mark Rodriguez\nGrips \u2014 Dan Martinez, Sergio Nava, & Angel Villarreal\nArt Director \u2014 Craig Smith\nPA \u2014 Eli Paul\n \nStarring \u2014 Richie The Barber, Chris Andrews, Kyle Brown, Stacey Kenealy, Gordana Simunovic, Austin Spacy, & Mark Laursen", "TROLLS (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) out now! \niTunes: http://smarturl.it/Trolls?IQid=dwyt \nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/StreamTrollsOST?IQid=dwyt\nAmazon: http://smarturl.it/TrollsAmz?IQid=dwyt\nGoogle Play: http://smarturl.it/TrollsOSTGP?IQid=dwyt \n\nPhysical copies available at Walmart: http://smarturl.it/TrollsWalmart?IQid=dwyt | Target:http://smarturl.it/TrollsTarget?IQid=dwyt | Best Buy: http://smarturl.it/TrollsBestBuy?IQid=dwyt | FYE:http://smarturl.it/TrollsFYE?IQid=dwyt\n\nFrom the creators of SHREK comes DreamWorks Animation\u2019s TROLLS, a smart, funny and irreverent comedy about the search for happiness, and just how far some will go to get it.  This hilarious film transports audiences to a colorful, wondrous world populated by the overly optimistic Trolls, who have a constant dance in their step and a song on their lips, and the comically pessimistic Bergens, who are only happy when they have trolls in their stomachs.  \n\nAfter the Bergens invade Troll Village, Poppy (Kendrick), the happiest Troll ever born, and the overly-cautious curmudgeonly Branch (Timberlake) set off on a journey to rescue her friends.  Together, this mismatched duo embarks on a rescue mission full of adventure and mishaps \u2013 trying to tolerate each other long enough to get the job done.  \n\nUtilizing music to further the film's narrative, the TROLLS soundtrack is produced by Justin Timberlake and features five original songs including songs by Justin Timberlake, Ariana Grande, Anna Kendrick and Gwen Stefani, in addition to a number of classic hits from the \u201860s through the \u201880s. \n\n\nFollow DreamWorksTV! \ninstagram - https://instagram.com/dreamworkstv/\ntwitter - https://twitter.com/dreamworkstv\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/dreamworkstv\n\nJoin the fun on DreamWorksTV where you can find an endless supply of laugh-out-loud jokes, lovable characters, life hacks, music, magic, gaming and more!

The Grinch tells the story of a cynical grump who goes on a mission to steal Christmas, only to have his heart changed by a young girl\u2019s generous holiday spirit.  Funny, heartwarming and visually stunning, it\u2019s a universal story about the spirit of Christmas and the indomitable power of optimism.\n \nAcademy Award\u00ae nominee Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to the infamous Grinch, who lives a solitary life inside a cave on Mt. Crumpet with only his loyal dog, Max, for company.  With a cave rigged with inventions and contraptions for his day-to-day needs, the Grinch only sees his neighbors in Who-ville when he runs out of food.\n \nEach year at Christmas they disrupt his tranquil solitude with their increasingly bigger, brighter and louder celebrations.  When the Whos declare they are going to make Christmas three times bigger this year, the Grinch realizes there is only one way for him to gain some peace and quiet: he must steal Christmas.  To do so, he decides he will pose as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, even going so far as to trap a lackadaisical misfit reindeer to pull his sleigh.\n \nMeanwhile, down in Who-ville, Cindy-Lou Who\u2014a young girl overflowing with holiday cheer\u2014plots with her gang of friends to trap Santa Claus as he makes his Christmas Eve rounds so that she can thank him for help for her overworked single mother.  As Christmas approaches, however, her good-natured scheme threatens to collide with the Grinch\u2019s more nefarious one.  Will Cindy-Lou achieve her goal of finally meeting Santa Claus?  Will the Grinch succeed in silencing the Whos\u2019 holiday cheer once and for all?\n \nFind out, Christmas season 2018.", "Moonshine Jungle Tour 2014 tickets and more info: \nhttp://www.brunomars.com/moonshinejungletour\n\nAvailable now on iTunes! http://smarturl.it/Doo-Wops\n\n\u00a9 2011 WMG.

And it takes us beyond the stars to the far reaches of the universe in search of life somewhere other than Earth.\n\nTo date, astronomers have detected over 3000 planets located outside the solar system. When one thinks that twenty years ago, the only planets we could observe were those in our own solar system, this is both a revolution and a revelation.\n\nWith the construction of giant telescopes, thousands or even millions of other worlds will soon be discovered. These so-called exoplanets are all very different. But could any of them support life? The most recent research shows that life is much more tenacious and resilient than we once thought.\n\nAre we alone in the universe? This question, which for so long was chiefly a religious and philosophical one, has now become rational and scientific. If other inhabited planets exist, how can we detect them? How can we discover what flora, fauna or even what kind of strange civilisations they may host?

Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed.\n\nThis model, known as the nebular hypothesis was first developed in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace. Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy, physics, geology, and planetary science. Since the dawn of the space age in the 1950s and the discovery of extrasolar planets in the 1990s, the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations.\n\nThe Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation. Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets, while other moons are thought to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets. Still others, such as Earth's Moon, may be the result of giant collisions. Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System. The positions of the planets might have shifted due to gravitational interactions. This planetary migration is now thought to have been responsible for much of the Solar System's early evolution.\n\nIn roughly 5 billion years, the Sun will cool and expand outward to many times its current diameter (becoming a red giant), before casting off its outer layers as a planetary nebula and leaving behind a stellar remnant known as a white dwarf. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, others ejected into interstellar space. Ultimately, over the course of tens of billions of years, it is likely that the Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it", "Twitter : https://twitter.com/Blaz_ey_Fear_ey\nIG : https://www.instagram.com/callme_blaze/\nBadge Grinder Twitter: https://twitter.com/2kGrindBadges4U", "Foster The People's \u201cWorst Nites\u201d is available now: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites\n \nAmazon Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/az\nApple Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/applemusic\niTunes: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/itunes\nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/spotify\nYouTube Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/youtubemusic\n \nFollow Foster The People:\nhttp://fosterthepeople.com\nhttp://facebook.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://twitter.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://instagram.com/fosterthepeople\n\nDirectors \u2014 Mark Foster & Josh Hutcherson\nWritten by Josh Hutcherson & Mark Foster\nProduction Company \u2014 Burning Film (burningfilm.com)\nProducer \u2014 Ryland Burns\nCo-Producer - Josh Hutcherson\nCinematographer \u2014 Dannel Escallon\nProduction Designer \u2014 Tyler Evans\nEditor \u2014 John-Michael Powell\nColorist \u2013 Derek Hansen\nCo-Producer \u2014 Christo Arsenio\n1st AD \u2014 Rene Gannon-O\u2019Gara\nWardrobe \u2014 Debbie Gonzalez\nMakeup \u2014 Nikoleta Skarlaty\nCasting \u2014 Jonathan Buckley\nChoreographer \u2014 Chris Scott\n1st AC \u2014 Steve Doyle\n2nd AC \u2014 Ajiri Akpolo\nSteadicam \u2014 Aaron Gantt\nGaffer \u2014 Albert Gonzalez\nKey Grip \u2014 Mark Rodriguez\nGrips \u2014 Dan Martinez, Sergio Nava, & Angel Villarreal\nArt Director \u2014 Craig Smith\nPA \u2014 Eli Paul\n \nStarring \u2014 Richie The Barber, Chris Andrews, Kyle Brown, Stacey Kenealy, Gordana Simunovic, Austin Spacy, & Mark Laursen", "TROLLS (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) out now! \niTunes: http://smarturl.it/Trolls?IQid=dwyt \nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/StreamTrollsOST?IQid=dwyt\nAmazon: http://smarturl.it/TrollsAmz?IQid=dwyt\nGoogle Play: http://smarturl.it/TrollsOSTGP?IQid=dwyt \n\nPhysical copies available at Walmart: http://smarturl.it/TrollsWalmart?IQid=dwyt | Target:http://smarturl.it/TrollsTarget?IQid=dwyt | Best Buy: http://smarturl.it/TrollsBestBuy?IQid=dwyt | FYE:http://smarturl.it/TrollsFYE?IQid=dwyt\n\nFrom the creators of SHREK comes DreamWorks Animation\u2019s TROLLS, a smart, funny and irreverent comedy about the search for happiness, and just how far some will go to get it.  This hilarious film transports audiences to a colorful, wondrous world populated by the overly optimistic Trolls, who have a constant dance in their step and a song on their lips, and the comically pessimistic Bergens, who are only happy when they have trolls in their stomachs.  \n\nAfter the Bergens invade Troll Village, Poppy (Kendrick), the happiest Troll ever born, and the overly-cautious curmudgeonly Branch (Timberlake) set off on a journey to rescue her friends.  Together, this mismatched duo embarks on a rescue mission full of adventure and mishaps \u2013 trying to tolerate each other long enough to get the job done.  \n\nUtilizing music to further the film's narrative, the TROLLS soundtrack is produced by Justin Timberlake and features five original songs including songs by Justin Timberlake, Ariana Grande, Anna Kendrick and Gwen Stefani, in addition to a number of classic hits from the \u201860s through the \u201880s. \n\n\nFollow DreamWorksTV! \ninstagram - https://instagram.com/dreamworkstv/\ntwitter - https://twitter.com/dreamworkstv\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/dreamworkstv\n\nJoin the fun on DreamWorksTV where you can find an endless supply of laugh-out-loud jokes, lovable characters, life hacks, music, magic, gaming and more!

The Grinch tells the story of a cynical grump who goes on a mission to steal Christmas, only to have his heart changed by a young girl\u2019s generous holiday spirit.  Funny, heartwarming and visually stunning, it\u2019s a universal story about the spirit of Christmas and the indomitable power of optimism.\n \nAcademy Award\u00ae nominee Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to the infamous Grinch, who lives a solitary life inside a cave on Mt. Crumpet with only his loyal dog, Max, for company.  With a cave rigged with inventions and contraptions for his day-to-day needs, the Grinch only sees his neighbors in Who-ville when he runs out of food.\n \nEach year at Christmas they disrupt his tranquil solitude with their increasingly bigger, brighter and louder celebrations.  When the Whos declare they are going to make Christmas three times bigger this year, the Grinch realizes there is only one way for him to gain some peace and quiet: he must steal Christmas.  To do so, he decides he will pose as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, even going so far as to trap a lackadaisical misfit reindeer to pull his sleigh.\n \nMeanwhile, down in Who-ville, Cindy-Lou Who\u2014a young girl overflowing with holiday cheer\u2014plots with her gang of friends to trap Santa Claus as he makes his Christmas Eve rounds so that she can thank him for help for her overworked single mother.  As Christmas approaches, however, her good-natured scheme threatens to collide with the Grinch\u2019s more nefarious one.  Will Cindy-Lou achieve her goal of finally meeting Santa Claus?  Will the Grinch succeed in silencing the Whos\u2019 holiday cheer once and for all?\n \nFind out, Christmas season 2018.", "Moonshine Jungle Tour 2014 tickets and more info: \nhttp://www.brunomars.com/moonshinejungletour\n\nAvailable now on iTunes! http://smarturl.it/Doo-Wops\n\n\u00a9 2011 WMG.

And it takes us beyond the stars to the far reaches of the universe in search of life somewhere other than Earth.\n\nTo date, astronomers have detected over 3000 planets located outside the solar system. When one thinks that twenty years ago, the only planets we could observe were those in our own solar system, this is both a revolution and a revelation.\n\nWith the construction of giant telescopes, thousands or even millions of other worlds will soon be discovered. These so-called exoplanets are all very different. But could any of them support life? The most recent research shows that life is much more tenacious and resilient than we once thought.\n\nAre we alone in the universe? This question, which for so long was chiefly a religious and philosophical one, has now become rational and scientific. If other inhabited planets exist, how can we detect them? How can we discover what flora, fauna or even what kind of strange civilisations they may host?

Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed.\n\nThis model, known as the nebular hypothesis was first developed in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace. Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy, physics, geology, and planetary science. Since the dawn of the space age in the 1950s and the discovery of extrasolar planets in the 1990s, the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations.\n\nThe Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation. Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets, while other moons are thought to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets. Still others, such as Earth's Moon, may be the result of giant collisions. Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System. The positions of the planets might have shifted due to gravitational interactions. This planetary migration is now thought to have been responsible for much of the Solar System's early evolution.\n\nIn roughly 5 billion years, the Sun will cool and expand outward to many times its current diameter (becoming a red giant), before casting off its outer layers as a planetary nebula and leaving behind a stellar remnant known as a white dwarf. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, others ejected into interstellar space. Ultimately, over the course of tens of billions of years, it is likely that the Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it", "Twitter : https://twitter.com/Blaz_ey_Fear_ey\nIG : https://www.instagram.com/callme_blaze/\nBadge Grinder Twitter: https://twitter.com/2kGrindBadges4U", "Foster The People's \u201cWorst Nites\u201d is available now: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites\n \nAmazon Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/az\nApple Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/applemusic\niTunes: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/itunes\nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/spotify\nYouTube Music: http://smarturl.it/WorstNites/youtubemusic\n \nFollow Foster The People:\nhttp://fosterthepeople.com\nhttp://facebook.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://twitter.com/fosterthepeople\nhttp://instagram.com/fosterthepeople\n\nDirectors \u2014 Mark Foster & Josh Hutcherson\nWritten by Josh Hutcherson & Mark Foster\nProduction Company \u2014 Burning Film (burningfilm.com)\nProducer \u2014 Ryland Burns\nCo-Producer - Josh Hutcherson\nCinematographer \u2014 Dannel Escallon\nProduction Designer \u2014 Tyler Evans\nEditor \u2014 John-Michael Powell\nColorist \u2013 Derek Hansen\nCo-Producer \u2014 Christo Arsenio\n1st AD \u2014 Rene Gannon-O\u2019Gara\nWardrobe \u2014 Debbie Gonzalez\nMakeup \u2014 Nikoleta Skarlaty\nCasting \u2014 Jonathan Buckley\nChoreographer \u2014 Chris Scott\n1st AC \u2014 Steve Doyle\n2nd AC \u2014 Ajiri Akpolo\nSteadicam \u2014 Aaron Gantt\nGaffer \u2014 Albert Gonzalez\nKey Grip \u2014 Mark Rodriguez\nGrips \u2014 Dan Martinez, Sergio Nava, & Angel Villarreal\nArt Director \u2014 Craig Smith\nPA \u2014 Eli Paul\n \nStarring \u2014 Richie The Barber, Chris Andrews, Kyle Brown, Stacey Kenealy, Gordana Simunovic, Austin Spacy, & Mark Laursen", "TROLLS (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) out now! \niTunes: http://smarturl.it/Trolls?IQid=dwyt \nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/StreamTrollsOST?IQid=dwyt\nAmazon: http://smarturl.it/TrollsAmz?IQid=dwyt\nGoogle Play: http://smarturl.it/TrollsOSTGP?IQid=dwyt \n\nPhysical copies available at Walmart: http://smarturl.it/TrollsWalmart?IQid=dwyt | Target:http://smarturl.it/TrollsTarget?IQid=dwyt | Best Buy: http://smarturl.it/TrollsBestBuy?IQid=dwyt | FYE:http://smarturl.it/TrollsFYE?IQid=dwyt\n\nFrom the creators of SHREK comes DreamWorks Animation\u2019s TROLLS, a smart, funny and irreverent comedy about the search for happiness, and just how far some will go to get it.  This hilarious film transports audiences to a colorful, wondrous world populated by the overly optimistic Trolls, who have a constant dance in their step and a song on their lips, and the comically pessimistic Bergens, who are only happy when they have trolls in their stomachs.  \n\nAfter the Bergens invade Troll Village, Poppy (Kendrick), the happiest Troll ever born, and the overly-cautious curmudgeonly Branch (Timberlake) set off on a journey to rescue her friends.  Together, this mismatched duo embarks on a rescue mission full of adventure and mishaps \u2013 trying to tolerate each other long enough to get the job done.  \n\nUtilizing music to further the film's narrative, the TROLLS soundtrack is produced by Justin Timberlake and features five original songs including songs by Justin Timberlake, Ariana Grande, Anna Kendrick and Gwen Stefani, in addition to a number of classic hits from the \u201860s through the \u201880s. \n\n\nFollow DreamWorksTV! \ninstagram - https://instagram.com/dreamworkstv/\ntwitter - https://twitter.com/dreamworkstv\nfacebook - https://www.facebook.com/dreamworkstv\n\nJoin the fun on DreamWorksTV where you can find an endless supply of laugh-out-loud jokes, lovable characters, life hacks, music, magic, gaming and more!
